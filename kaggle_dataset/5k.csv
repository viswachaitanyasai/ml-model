1,i was looking for a kindle whitepaper i saw online for what a deal i ordered it on line and picked it up in the store i got it home and couldnt adjust the brightness after a lengthy time with online customer service i called customer service after minuets with speaking to a female elmer fud that doesnt speak english well i figured i would just return it although it looks identical to the model you can not adjust the brightness that would have been good information before i bought it,"{'neg': 0.097, 'neu': 0.869, 'pos': 0.034, 'compound': -0.5239}",negative
1,looking at the picture and seeing it was th generation i assumed it would be a great device i had an original kindle but i stopped using it because it wasnt backlit i thought an th generation would be backlit and the picture makes it look backlit but it is not after minutes on the phone with amazon trying to make it brighter the technician finally realized that th generation is not supported with backlights i took it back to target and purchased the paperwhite which was more money but definitely worth it the th generation one is smaller so i assumed that was the reason for the price difference target made the experience pleasant,"{'neg': 0.039, 'neu': 0.797, 'pos': 0.164, 'compound': 0.9393}",positive

4,if you are looking for something to help you keep more organized or keep you up to date with weather markets and the latest news the amazon echo show is what you are looking for honestly the product is top of the line technology and is easy to use as long you are patient and work with it and read the directions the size of it is truly perfect it honestly reminds me of the size of normal alarm clock that would have on a nightstand and with that it truly can serve that purpose it also has a touch screen and i feel it is very durable and can stand to last the sound quality is also superb with dual inch speakers it has bluetooth capabilities as well but it only works with android samsung fire os ios device excluding mac products the echo show comes in two colors black and white the product has many different features and functions and they can accommodate pretty much anyones needs the top feature is the alexa app which is an application in which you can call commands and ask it questions about most anything then i believe the music capabilities are truly amazing and how you can ask it to play almost any song or playlist whenever you want also you can tell it to volume up or down as well another new modernized technology it has is the capability to do hands free voice command smart home options a couple things that could be improved is sometimes that it does not fully hear your exact words and it will search for something you arent expecting the other function it could have is it could have single voice recognition to only several voices so then you dont have the entire room trying to mess with it constantly the price is also fair as well for its creative capabilities it has so if you are trying to find some new technology to add to your home the echo show would be a great addition for you,"{'neg': 0.021, 'neu': 0.797, 'pos': 0.182, 'compound': 0.9955}",positive

4,the alexa show was purchased to replace another much older device and while the show is a good device it is lacking in some aspects that i had in the older device im not sure if im missing it in the show but i was able to get internet cameras on the older device such as san diego zoo elephants that you cant get on the show while certainly not a deal breaker it was fun to watch setup was pretty straight forward and easy it is a good aspect that we can talk to the device and it knows what we want to a certain extent it is very literal at times and you have to make sure you have the exact code words or you get something other than what you want such as play or start or open i use it as an alarm clock and it is quite easy to set up the same time for my week but it would be a little more difficult if you have to work one weekend day of the week and then more or other combination you would have to set up several different alarms one for each day as far as i can see some of the alarm sound choices are a bit alarming i dont really want to be terrified awake each day i found one that was mellow and at a moderate sound level works well it would be nice to be able to add your own alarm sounds so you could have it customized to what youd like i dont see that yet anywhere another thing about the alarm is if you try to dismiss it and touch the screen the wrong way it puts the alarm into snooze mode instead of turning it off if you tell it to dismiss the alarm it works fine but there are times id rather not say anything at that time of day and just dismiss it with a swipe which is possible but very sensitive and if you miss here comes snooze just little things that may get fixed in the future with enough feedback from the customers but some may not effect people as much as some people who have more impact with a particular anomaly i am thinking of getting a thermostat that hooks to it so i can monitor and change the heat and cooling but that is in the future at this time hoping that works well when it arrivesit will be nice to raise the temp a degree in the cold of winter without having to get out of the warmth of the bed all in all id say its a good emerging technology but needs a little work considering this type of thing was science fiction not too long ago its kind of where were heading,"{'neg': 0.082, 'neu': 0.79, 'pos': 0.128, 'compound': 0.9754}",positive

4,ive had lots of tablets in the past mostly from the samsung line but this is my first amazon fire so i want to write this review for others who have never tried one of these at the time that this was written alexa had not been added to the tabletfirst while this device runs an android type of operating system amazon puts its own spin on the operating system i dont feel like im using android this feels different to me it doesnt have the same level of customization that android users have come to appreciate that being said if you are an amazon prime member this device has been tailored to be your content entertainment machine its simply a fun way to consume your magazines books etcthere are onscreen buttons on the bottom of the device the middle button immediately takes you to your home screen the button to the left acts as a sort of back button it also lets me get rid of my keyboard when i dont need it on screen but its open the button to the right is super important it took me a couple of days to realize what it does that square shaped button is what you press you see what apps you have open it lets you switch between apps but it also lets you see which apps you have open and close them out you can close them by pressing the x button in the corner of the window that appears or by touching the app window and swiping to the right if you leave all of those apps open and you never close them youll drain your battery make sure you use that little square button to clear your appsthe device has several menus that you swipe left to view first you start with your home screen you literally can stay on this screen and do anything you need to do on the tablet all of your apps are housed here you swipe up to view all of them the tablet comes with several apps preinstalled such as slik amazons own internet browser audible good reads the amazon app store a weather app etc you can go to the amazon app store to download other apps such as twitter facebook etc you can combine the apps on this page into folders you just drag one app to another app and a folder appears this made my home screen much more manageable you can change the size of the font on the home screen from normal to large or small in the device settings this feature doesnt necessarily increase the size of the font within your apps however i believe it only changes the font on your main screensif you have a magazine or newspaper subscription that is connected to your device when you have a new issues it will show up at the top of your home page screen under the heading of new items the device comes with a free month subscription to the washington post youll see that under new items when you initially activate your tabletyou can change the wallpaper on the screen to use one of your own photos you can do this through the settings menu on the device if you want to use one of your own photos however you need to either take it on the device or move it into amazons photos app which is a cloudbased appso far i havent found a way to effectively use a different photo management app that will let me change my wallpaper im not crazy about the amazon photo app i found it annoying to move my photos from my phone into amazons cloud just so i could view them on my tablet that being said im not planning to take photos on this device i just wanted a few pet photos on there and the ability to change my wallpaperbeyond the home screen you can swipe to the right to view your other screen they are prearranged to be books videos games shop apps music audiobooks and newstand all of those screens are connected to your amazon account for example if you have kindle books youve already purchased they automatically will appear under the books menu your magazines and newspaper subscriptions will appear under the newstand menu there doesnt seem to be a way to change the order of the menu pages that bugs me but its not the end of the world theres also one menu to the left of the home menu its the recent page it shows you what youve received looked at on the tablet i never use it but it might be handy for some peopleone of my favorite features of this tablet is amazons on deck capability if youre an amazon prime member amazon will periodically download a video to your device that it thinks you might like the items dont count against your preinstalled memory and they automatically deleted off if your memory starts getting full you can turn off the on deck feature if you dont like it ive been content with the video playback capability this isnt my major use of the device but the images look fine and the audio is ok ill talk more about the speakers later my other favorite feature of this tablet is viewing magazine content through the newstand ive tried magazines on here and they all look gorgeous now i can always have my magazines with me so if im stuck at the airport or at the doctors office i always have them one of my regular magazines includes a free digital version of the magazine for free i just had to connect my account to the device this allows me to download the back issues of the magazine for as long as ive had an account my other magazine didnt include a digital edition so i canceled the print edition of it and switched to the digital version it was an inexpensive magazine anyway there are several magazines that you can try free for days on the device i did this with a third magazine and decided to keep it for a year viewing magazines on this gadget is a pleasurethe kindle fire doesnt come with the google play store installed you can side load it to the device without rooting it and breaking your warranty you can google to find the instructions to do this its not difficult to do if youre fairly comfortable with technology it probably took me minutes most of the apps i wanted were in the amazon store but there were a handful that i had paid for through google play the only way i could have them was to go back to access that store they have worked fine so far i despise the keyboard that amazon preinstalled on this device there are no lines between the letters on the keyboard i suppose it designed to be better for swyping through keys but i hate it i fixed that problem by going to google play and downloading a new keyboard it was a pretty easy problem to solve so i cant complainapps that are connecting to the internet can be a little slow to load on this device compared to my other gadgets but that generally doesnt bother me if you were using this tablet to replace your personal laptop however that might drive you crazy the screen on this device isnt bad if i compare it to my fancy phone its not as shape but when you think about the price of this device compared to my smartphone the screen is outstandingthe speakers are ok there are two of them located on the bottom of the screen i wont say that they are fantastic they arent in my opinion they are fine for watching youtube or a television show they are not ok for listening to music if you are an audiophile you can make it a little better by downloading a different music app instead of relying on the preinstall app but still your music will sound tinny that being said you can always connect your tablet to a bluetooth speaker use a pair of headphones etcthis device wasnt made for taking pictures it has a front and back camera but they arent designed to be spectacular im not using themi find this device a little difficult to hold in my hands i think thats partly because of the size and partly because it feels very slick also i do have some hand problems similar to someone who has carpal tunnel syndrome i think it will be easier to handle once my case arrives im still waiting for it im greatly enjoying this device its simply fun to use the tablet there are weaknesses that come with that lower price tag but you legitimately get a lot of bang for your buck particularly if you regularly use amazon services if you dont typically use amazon and you are just looking for a tablet for viewing the internet and youre looking for a low price tag this device may be ok for you,"{'neg': 0.04, 'neu': 0.845, 'pos': 0.115,

4,ive had lots of tablets in the past mostly from the samsung line but this is my first amazon fire so i want to write this review for others who have never tried one of these at the time that this was written alexa had not been added to the tabletfirst while this device runs an android type of operating system amazon puts its own spin on the operating system i dont feel like im using android this feels different to me it doesnt have the same level of customization that android users have come to appreciate that being said if you are an amazon prime member this device has been tailored to be your content entertainment machine its simply a fun way to consume your magazines books etcthere are onscreen buttons on the bottom of the device the middle button immediately takes you to your home screen the button to the left acts as a sort of back button it also lets me get rid of my keyboard when i dont need it on screen but its open the button to the right is super important it took me a couple of days to realize what it does that square shaped button is what you press you see what apps you have open it lets you switch between apps but it also lets you see which apps you have open and close them out you can close them by pressing the x button in the corner of the window that appears or by touching the app window and swiping to the right if you leave all of those apps open and you never close them youll drain your battery make sure you use that little square button to clear your appsthe device has several menus that you swipe left to view first you start with your home screen you literally can stay on this screen and do anything you need to do on the tablet all of your apps are housed here you swipe up to view all of them the tablet comes with several apps preinstalled such as slik amazons own internet browser audible good reads the amazon app store a weather app etc you can go to the amazon app store to download other apps such as twitter facebook etc you can combine the apps on this page into folders you just drag one app to another app and a folder appears this made my home screen much more manageable you can change the size of the font on the home screen from normal to large or small in the device settings this feature doesnt necessarily increase the size of the font within your apps however i believe it only changes the font on your main screensif you have a magazine or newspaper subscription that is connected to your device when you have a new issues it will show up at the top of your home page screen under the heading of new items the device comes with a free month subscription to the washington post youll see that under new items when you initially activate your tabletyou can change the wallpaper on the screen to use one of your own photos you can do this through the settings menu on the device if you want to use one of your own photos however you need to either take it on the device or move it into amazons photos app which is a cloudbased appso far i havent found a way to effectively use a different photo management app that will let me change my wallpaper im not crazy about the amazon photo app i found it annoying to move my photos from my phone into amazons cloud just so i could view them on my tablet that being said im not planning to take photos on this device i just wanted a few pet photos on there and the ability to change my wallpaperbeyond the home screen you can swipe to the right to view your other screen they are prearranged to be books videos games shop apps music audiobooks and newstand all of those screens are connected to your amazon account for example if you have kindle books youve already purchased they automatically will appear under the books menu your magazines and newspaper subscriptions will appear under the newstand menu there doesnt seem to be a way to change the order of the menu pages that bugs me but its not the end of the world theres also one menu to the left of the home menu its the recent page it shows you what youve received looked at on the tablet i never use it but it might be handy for some peopleone of my favorite features of this tablet is amazons on deck capability if youre an amazon prime member amazon will periodically download a video to your device that it thinks you might like the items dont count against your preinstalled memory and they automatically deleted off if your memory starts getting full you can turn off the on deck feature if you dont like it ive been content with the video playback capability this isnt my major use of the device but the images look fine and the audio is ok ill talk more about the speakers later my other favorite feature of this tablet is viewing magazine content through the newstand ive tried magazines on here and they all look gorgeous now i can always have my magazines with me so if im stuck at the airport or at the doctors office i always have them one of my regular magazines includes a free digital version of the magazine for free i just had to connect my account to the device this allows me to download the back issues of the magazine for as long as ive had an account my other magazine didnt include a digital edition so i canceled the print edition of it and switched to the digital version it was an inexpensive magazine anyway there are several magazines that you can try free for days on the device i did this with a third magazine and decided to keep it for a year viewing magazines on this gadget is a pleasurethe kindle fire doesnt come with the google play store installed you can side load it to the device without rooting it and breaking your warranty you can google to find the instructions to do this its not difficult to do if youre fairly comfortable with technology it probably took me minutes most of the apps i wanted were in the amazon store but there were a handful that i had paid for through google play the only way i could have them was to go back to access that store they have worked fine so far i despise the keyboard that amazon preinstalled on this device there are no lines between the letters on the keyboard i suppose it designed to be better for swyping through keys but i hate it i fixed that problem by going to google play and downloading a new keyboard it was a pretty easy problem to solve so i cant complainapps that are connecting to the internet can be a little slow to load on this device compared to my other gadgets but that generally doesnt bother me if you were using this tablet to replace your personal laptop however that might drive you crazy the screen on this device isnt bad if i compare it to my fancy phone its not as shape but when you think about the price of this device compared to my smartphone the screen is outstandingthe speakers are ok there are two of them located on the bottom of the screen i wont say that they are fantastic they arent in my opinion they are fine for watching youtube or a television show they are not ok for listening to music if you are an audiophile you can make it a little better by downloading a different music app instead of relying on the preinstall app but still your music will sound tinny that being said you can always connect your tablet to a bluetooth speaker use a pair of headphones etcthis device wasnt made for taking pictures it has a front and back camera but they arent designed to be spectacular im not using themi find this device a little difficult to hold in my hands i think thats partly because of the size and partly because it feels very slick also i do have some hand problems similar to someone who has carpal tunnel syndrome i think it will be easier to handle once my case arrives im still waiting for it im greatly enjoying this device its simply fun to use the tablet there are weaknesses that come with that lower price tag but you legitimately get a lot of bang for your buck particularly if you regularly use amazon services if you dont typically use amazon and you are just looking for a tablet for viewing the internet and youre looking for a low price tag this device may be ok for you,"{'neg': 0.04, 'neu': 0.845, 'pos': 0.115,

4,this tablet is designed primarily to sell distribute and store media purchased from the amazoncom product line ie kindle ebooks movies viewed or stored from their online movie streaming service etc and it does that very wellreasonably sharp screen good sound good battery life and decent component materials it uses their version of the android os which they call the fire os which is decently responsive and fairly intuitive to use be aware that you cannot install or run most apps purchased from the google play store but must rely on amazons own app store which is decent but not as extensive as either apples or googles,"{'neg': 0.026, 'neu': 0.908, 'pos': 0.066, 'compound': 0.5423}",positive

5,alexa show is really well put together the main reason for my purchase was to create my own surveillance system linking my ring doorbell and ring floodlights to view on command by alexa on the show screen yes you can talk to it and get results for almost any query but with the show you get a lot more the touch screen is great for video calls especially when you install the alexa app on your family cell phones alexa can scan items via upc and order them on amazon or tell you where to get them the recipes you ask for are not only spoken to you but shown to you also when music plays you can see the lyrics on screen if you use amazon music to play the music you can ask for a news briefing and you see the news highlights etc the speakers arent quite up to the same standard as the echo series but its close the sound fills the room nicely when the echo show is not being immediately used the screen shows a picture of your choice making it a digital frame too overall the device is very nice and they are constantly releasing new skills for alexa to use so it seems like there is always something new to wow you turning on and off lights adjusting your thermostat playing music viewing security cameras are all just the standard duties there is way more to do with this device,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.844, 'pos': 0.156, 'compound': 0.9909}",positive

5,when they first announced the kindle oasis i did not have much of a desire to upgrade from my st generation kindle paperwhite just as i felt when they announced the voyagei read a lot so my kindle travels with me throughout the day most of the time i have never had an issue with battery life i have only had it get really low a few times typically when i was traveling so again i originally did not see a lot of the value to the oasisas the reviews for the oasis came out i started to realize what i did not like about my paperwhite and i began to have an interest in upgrading my paperwhite to the either the oasis or possibly the voyage the main thing i noticed is that i took my paperwhite out of the amazon case quite a lot especially when i was in a seated position this slight reduction in weight made it much more comfortable to hold for longer reading sessions i had some other minor issues with my paperwhite like when reading in the dark i couldnt find an adjustment for the light that i preferred was a little too dim and was a brighter than i needed i decided to pass on the voyage because i really did not like the case options and the pressure sensitive page turn optionnow that i have the oasis i definitely think it was worth it for me i really appreciate the reduced weight when the cover is off not to mention the ease of removing the cover compared to the paperwhite it provides the same reading experience although i did get a resolution upgrade compared to my older paperwhite which is a plusthe oasis is really comfortable in my hand which helps me forget that it is there when i was holding my paperwhite with my left hand at times i would accidentally go back a page which drove me crazy even though its just a minor inconveniencei have the black model because it was the only option available unless i was willing to wait a few more months the build quality of the oasis and its case is very nice just like with the paperwhite and the amazon leather case for it the only concern i have is how well it will protect the kindle i will update the review if i find this to be a problemi loved my paperwhite and i will recommend it to anyone looking to upgrade from an older kindle or buying one for the first time it definitely is great and the better buy but i am glad i decided to order the oasis the reduced weight ergonomic design and page turn buttons make it worth the added cost,"{'neg': 0.032, 'neu': 0.857, 'pos': 0.111, 'compound': 0.9811}",positive

5,despite not being able to get one of these from amazon until late june due to apparent strong demand best buy was able to get one to me on the day of its release april well done best buy having owned several previous kindles including the most recent paperwhite model i was unprepared for how small and light this new oasis model is reading about it is one thing but actually holding one in your hand is something else entirely the oasis and its batterycharging cover together weigh only one ounce more than the latest paperwhite with no case the oasis without its cover feels impossibly light at ounces sizewise the oasis is nearly a square shape at about wide by tall in fact the shape is so different from traditional kindle designs that i had to compare it next to my paperwhite to verify that the screens are actually the same size they are its the first kindle i think i could easily fit into a jacket pocket without any effort for frequent travelers like me this is a key reason to buy one of these as its extremely compact and easy to pack in a briefcase or purse the screen is the first frontlit kindle ive ever seen where you simply cannot see any trace of the leds from any angle no dark spots no bright spotsjust a completely uniform illumination from edge to edge in both directions the page also appears to be nearly flush with the top glass surface helping achieve the illusion of printed paper its sharp and clear better than any kindle ive used the reader can be easily separated from the battery case by simply pulling them apart since they are held together with magnets after doing so this is where the amazon engineering teams achievements really become clear as you just wont believe how lightweight this thing is its easy to imagine holding onto it for hours without any arm fatigue and switching from hand to hand is a simple matter of rotating it degrees when switching the display instantly rotates and the page turn buttons also follow with the top button always used to advance the page and the bottom button always used to go backward you can also use the screen to change pages as you always have with earlier touch screen models the battery on the reader has a lower capacity than the covers battery so it runs down faster if you dont have it connected to the case its very easy to snap the reader back into its cover which allows it to recharge while you continue to read the power button and charge port are located in the upper topright corner more or less opposite from where they are on the paperwhite i find this location to be less awkward as its easier to reach on the top than it is on the bottom edge the back surface of the reader not the case seems to easily attract fingerprints and they are not so easy to clean off youd think that amazon would have figured out a way to prevent this by now its a minor annoyance lots of reviewers in the tech press have complained loudly about this models high price relative to other kindle models without ads its vs for an adless paperwhite is this a lot of money perhaps but if you are a book addict and value an extremely lightweight reader thats easy on both your arms and your eyes then i personally think its worth it a lot of thought and effort clearly went into designing and building this unit and the price reflects that is it for everyone probably not but there is obviously a market for it when you consider how many months youll have to wait to get one on amazons website if you are a serious reader this device deserves a very close look im definitely keeping mine,"{'neg': 0.032, 'neu': 0.808, 'pos': 0.16, 'compound': 0.9982}",positive
