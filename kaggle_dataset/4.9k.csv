1,having used sandisk before in my photography i of course went to them when it was time to outfit my new samsung galaxy s with an internal microsd card i spent the extra bucks over comparably no name micro sd cards and bought this variant i took quite a few pictures and even transferred an album from my computer so i coud show it to friends on the goafter less than two months the sandisk microsd card started acting up it was not recognized stopped restarted removed itself reinstalled itself onto the phone erratic behavior here is where i should have taken it out immediately and tried to recover anything i could before things hit the fanunfortunately i waited too long and this morning for no other reason than i turned my phone on the card shows up as blank neither my windows pc nor my mac can even detect the card and yes i tried two different adapters and i tried the sandisk recovery which found no recoverable files even though i checked all file type extensionsive apparently lost all the pictures i had on there to top it all off my gfs cheap no name card has never had an issue in her exact same phone and keeps chugging along merrilypaying a premium for a substandard product that fails in use after two months no thanks im going back to lexar which hasnt failed me yet im also getting rid of all my sandisk cards for my dslrs just in case the fact that sandisk is the first card thats ever failed on me and a new card to boot does not inspire confidence buy and use at your own risk,"{'neg': 0.082, 'neu': 0.857, 'pos': 0.06, 'compound': -0.652}",negative

1,it appears that the gb sandisk ultra micro sd card i purchased from amazon was defective i installed it in my samsung tablet but could not successfully transfer files using either a usb cable or wifi the file transfer would appear to start but then would slow down and hang completely it did this on every one of multiple attempts with different file types and numbers of files ranging from many to just a single file i tried loading files onto the card directly from my pc but then the tablet would not see them i tried reformatting the card both in my pc and in the tablet but still got the same result after a few tries the tablet would appear to format the card but then tell me that the card was blankunformatted i did an aba with an old gb sandisk micro sd card that i had laying around it worked perfectly formating transferring files reading and writing files everthing worked i put the gb sandisk ultra card back in the tablet but had the same problems again i concluded that the sandisk ultra card was defective and returned it im still using the old gb card without a hiccupthe good thing was that amazons return policy was quick and painless,"{'neg': 0.078, 'neu': 0.877, 'pos': 0.045, 'compound': -0.727}",negative

1,note please read the last update scroll to the bottom im leaving this review as star as it appears to help others who purchased and had a similar experiencei give sandisk stars for customer service and star for the product for those manufactured in the past for those newly manufactured products that contain the software rom fix id give the product starsto all those who purchased this card due to all the great reviews and then used it in a galaxy s gs smartphone for storage the solution to the problem is not one you can solve without returning the card to sandisk for a replacement under warranty believe me i tried everything that the google searches returned as solutions formatting as exfat formatting in the gs then copying data to the card while in the phone etc nothing worked and so now please stop pulling out your hair and hopefully you will get the same result which i hope to get soon just rmad and will send it back tomorrow for a free replacement under warrantythe problem as confirmed from the sandisk customer support rep when i asked specifically asked him when used in the gs this card will unmount itself inadvertently may be true only for cards manufactured before the rom patch described below was implemented in manufacturing this can cause the data to become corrupt luckily was not my experience and or can be very frustrating as most of us are saving mp camera pictures to the card or mp movies that stop in the middle of the movie and it unmounts when you view the picture in the gallery or worse right when you take the picture this was the issue i experienced sandisk knows about this issue again sandisk knows about the issue and will replace your card call them info below and they will take care of it under warranty they have a good name for a reason and they want to keep it sorry sandisk about the star but i thought it was the way to get the message out to those searching for a solution the customer rep told me that sandisk tried to work with samsung to resolve the issue but samsung refused to acknowledge a problem exists with this card and some of their phones especially their flagship gs phones the customer rep told me that to their knowledge the card works fine in regular cameras not samsung gs phones with cameras obviously and even worked fine in some phones from htc etc that could accommodate the gb cards hence the star ratings from others the solution sandisk came up with was to write a patch into the rom of the card itself to specifically address the issue on samsung gs phones and maybe other samsung phones like the gs i was assured that the new card i would get would work flawlessly will see in about weeks i purchased my card from amazon june so the ones currently being manufactured and the one i should get will have the new patch however as sandisk manufactures in batches like most of the industry old batches of unpatched cards obviously exist in warehouses i asked about a software patch i could download and was told its not possible hence the hard coded patch in the cards romso how to take care of the problemafter speaking with the sandisk us customer support link and info below this is what i learned and didgo to the sandisk site call consumer products support this is the us no sandisk tell them that the card is unmounting itself in your gs i assume this is also a problem experienced by gs owners too they will then confirm your information approve your return min approval window by mine was basically instantaneously and then send you emails with a ups return label and instructions btw they also asked if i had a magnifying glass to id the serial no on the card but i didnt and couldnt read it myself those numbers are super small printed into the plastic dont believe me take a look yourself i told the rep i couldnt read them and he said no problem they would process without the serial no i assume this is because they send you a new replacement card only when they receive your card you send in makes sensewell thats it problem hopefully solved lets see in weeks the rep was super nice about it and seemed like they were all too familiar with the problem kudos to sandisk for taking care of it however it would be nice if there was some type of communication notice of the issue besides google info sources forums etc i spent hours maybe a couple of days total hours worth thinking it was an issue with my phone my data transfer oh well thats how it goesi really hope that this review helps some of you out there with the same problem as me good luckbtw id give the card stars if this problem was solved in the patched rom of newer cards as the data transfer speeds are awesome on the card tested transferring data via a card reader hooked to my computer if the data transfer remaining mounted in the gs issue never existed prepatch of rom of courseupdate all went well with the return of the sandisk storage card ups shipping took about days from when i sent it sandisk verified the warranty claim day later and hours later that same day my replacement card had been shipped waiting on the new card now but expect to test it out very soon early next week will update the post after testing out the new card just as a reference ive been using a gb micro sd hc sandisk card in the gs since having shipped the gb card obviously its a different card and not the micro sd xc kind other than a bit slower access speeds to the card absolutely zero problems well if you dont count that its basically filled up hence why the gb option is great on the gs so it proves the point on the problem with the early build micro sd xc gb cardsim happy to see that my review has helped some others out there good luck to you in your warranty claim my experience with sandisk customer support has been excellent so farupdate received the new replacement sandisk storage card just a few days ago shipping back to me once they agreed it was defective was a very short time window have had it running in the galaxy s for a few days now without any jumps stutters or card unloading in the middle of picture or video taking card seems to work flawlessly as the sandisk rep mentioned it would one would think its such a short time to test after a few days of use but if this were not fixed already it would have dismounted in the first minutes thats how often and how fast it was occurring so it would seem the problem is solved the new sd card makes the phone even more responsive when moving between pictures in the gallery and performing other tasks like copying files to the card thanks sandisk unless i update this review by next week you will know that the problem has been fixedgood luck to those with similar problems as we now know how to get it fixed thanks to sandisks great responsive customer serviceupdate this is the last update to this review just to close the loop the new replacement card from sandisk has been running flawlessly for about weeks now i have not experienced any of the initial problems sandisk really did fix the issues in the new batch of cardsupdate the card has been running in my gs flawlessly since replacing it around aug st pretty good track record so far months so it appears to be fixed with the newly manufactured replacement cardsfor those that have left comments that i should change the rating upwards now that the issue is fixed see my addition at the beginning of this review when searching for a solution to a problem with a purchased product most people start at the star reviews to see what others have experienced this is especially true for products with a lot of reviews this is what i did in the beginning with this product therefore i think leaving it at star and adding the comments at the beginning should clarify the reviewthanks to review commenter da shocker for his input i think he sums it up very well when it comes to the value of files stored on media like thisone more thing to those not happy with the one star rating by this person go ahead buy one take tons of pics vids and save some music on there then when the card crashes come back and give it a five star a card cost pictures from a vacation or

3,maybe there is nothing that can be done and it is just the way the technology is at this time but to me it seems that the gb sd cards have very limited uses at this time because they are formatted in whats called exfat instead of the standard fat to get gb from a gb card after receiving my card and inserting it into my new android tablet with jelly bean it was recognized and it did show i had gb available i then removed the card from the tablet and inserted it into my computers a win and a vista and tried to transfer files photos and videos from my laptop to the card they would not transfer after some research on the internet it appeared that the card had to be reformatted from the new exfat to the standard fat all my files were created in win xp and win vista fat i also have a win machine i recently purchased and can easily move all types of files between all the machines and memory cards and flash drives but could not transfer any files to this card from any computer as long as the card was formatted in exfat i had read on the internet about reformatting the cards and it working my win machine does not even have the option to format to standard fat it only has nstf and exfat my older computers have the older fat format option and it took my vista computer with a dual core processor hours to reformat the card to fat after reformatting i was able to easily transfer my files photos and videos on my xp and vista computers but not the win computer the card works in my tablet and i am able to access and use all the files i transferred to the card in fat with my vista computer on the tablet but after reformatting it now the card only has gb of space available so it was essentially reformatted the gb card into a gb card i will keep the card because i have a lot of work into it reformatting and transferring files and hopefully in the future i can reformat it again back to exfat if and when exfat catches on and an os is made that can seamlessly use files created in both fat and exfat this seems to be a good card that works well in certain situations but my advice do your research on what you have and how you will use the card because this is not simply a big gb card that can be used for everything in every device unless all your files photos and videos are in or will be created with exfat there are some real draw backs to this card and you might be better off just buying multiple lower gb cards if you really need this much storage space in a micro sd card or perhaps cards you already own can be reformatted into exfat and double the capacity if your computer has the exfat reformat option i have not tried it but based on my experience the last few days it seems like it would work if exfat works for you i gave stars because it does work but i feel sandisk not fully explaining how they are getting gb out of this card and the possible problems a consumer might have with it is misleading advertising,"{'neg': 0.023, 'neu': 0.861, 'pos': 0.117, 'compound': 0.9961}",positive

5,update so my lovely wife bought me a samsung galaxy tab for fathers day and ive been loving it ever since just as other with samsung products the galaxy tab has the ability to add a microsd card to expand the memory on the device since its been over a year i decided to do some more research to see if sandisk offered anything new as of their product lineup for microsd cards from worst to best performancewise are the as followssandisksandisk ultrasandisk ultra plussandisk extremesandisk extreme plussandisk extreme pronow the difference between all of these cards are simply the speed in which you can readwrite data to the card yes the published rating of most all these cards except the sandisk regular are class uhsi but thats just a rating actual real world performance does get better with each model but with faster cards come more expensive prices since amazon doesnt carry the ultra plus model of microsd card i had to do direct comparisons between the sandisk ultra extreme and extreme plus as mentioned in my earlier review i purchased the sandisk ultra for my galaxy s my question was did i want to pay over more for a card that is faster than the one i already owned or i could pay almost double to get sandisks ndmost fastest microsd cardthe ultra works perfectly fine for my style of usage storingcapturing pictures hd video and movie playback on my phone so in the end i ended up just buying another sandisk ultra gb card i use my cell phone more than i do my tablet and if the card is good enough for my phone its good enough for my tablet i dont own a k hd camera or anything like that so i honestly didnt see a need to get one of the faster cards at this timei am now a proud owner of sandisk ultra cards and have absolutely issues with it in my samsung devices original review i havent had to buy a microsd card in a long time the last time i bought one was for my cell phone over years ago but since my cellular contract was up i knew i would have to get a newer card in addition to my new phone the samsung galaxy s reason for this is because i knew my small gb microsd card wasnt going to cut itdoing research on the galaxy s i wanted to get the best card possible that had decent capacity gb or greater this led me to find that the galaxy s supports the microsdxc class uhsi card which is the fastest possible given that class searching for that specifically on amazon gave me results of only vendors as of april that makes these microsdxc class uhs cards they are sandisk the majority samsung and lexar nobody else makes these that are sold on amazonseeing how sandisk is a pretty good name out of the ive used them the most i decided upon the sandisk because lexar was overpriced and the samsung one was overpriced as well as not eligible for amazon primebut the scary thing is that when you filter by the sandisk you literally get dozens of options all of them have different model numbers different sizes etc then theres that confusion of whats the difference between sdhc sdxcsdhc vs sdxcsdhc stand for secure digital high capacity and sdxc stands for secure digital extended capacity essentially these two cards are the same with the exception that sdhc only supports capcities up to gb and is formated with the fat file system the sdxc cards are formatted with the exfat file system if you use an sdxc card in a device it must support that file system otherwise it may not be recognizable andor you have to reformat the card to fatfat vs exfatthe differences between the two file systems means that fat has a maximum file size of gb limited by that file system exfat on the otherhand supports file sizes up to tb terabytes the only thing you need to know here really is that its possible your device doesnt support exfat if thats the case just reformat it to fat remember formatting erases all datato clarify the model numbers i i hopped over to the sandisk official webpage what i found there is that they offer two highspeed options for sandisk cards these are sandisk extreme pro and sandisk ultra sandisk extreme pro is a line that supports read speeds up to mbsec however they are sdhc only to make things worse they are currently only available in gb gb capacities since one of my requirements was to have a lot of storage i ruled these outthe remaining devices listed on amazons search were the sandisk ultra line but here confusion sets in because sandisk separates these cards to two different devices cameras mobile devices is there a real difference between the two or is this just a marketing stunt unfortunately im not sure but i do know the price difference between the two range from a couple cents to a few dollars since i wasnt sure i opted for the one specifically targeted for mobile devices just in case there is some kind of compatibility issue to find the exact model number i would go to sandisks webpage sandiskcom and compare their existing product lineup from there you get exact model numbers and you can then search amazon for these model numbers that is how i got mine sdsdquagas for speed tests i havent run any specific testing but copying gb worth of data from my pc to the card literally took just a few minutesone last note is that amazon attaches additional characters to the end for example sdsdquagaffpa vs sdsdquagua the difference between the two is that the affpa means amazon frustration free packaging other than that these are exactly the same if youre wondering what i got and want to use it in your galaxy s i got the sdsdquagua and it works like charm,"{'neg':
