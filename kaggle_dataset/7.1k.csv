1,i bought the other version of the keyboard and had to return it because it caused me contact dermatitis i was hopeful that this luxury material would be comfortable and its not sure at first it feels soft but eventually after spending a few minutes typing and thus moving my hands over it too they start to burn a little because of the keyboards rough surface im very dissapointed about the materials they choose sure they are marketed as luxurious but theyre not gentle for the skin i absolutly love my surface pro but i guess i will have to return it because i cant seem to find keyboard that wont actually make me feel in pain,"{'neg': 0.093, 'neu': 0.825, 'pos': 0.082, 'compound': -0.0984}",neutral
1,the keyboard is necessary to use the surface pro the surface does not cooperate well with generic wireless keyboards so i was forced to purchase this one typing is very bothersome for whatever reason the mousepad is overly sensitive and just hitting regular keys results in mouseclicks that put the cursor anywhere on the screen im very disappointed at the very poor quality of this keyboard,"{'neg': 0.194, 'neu': 0.806, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.9256}",negative

1,seriously they actually write the spec at watts thats beyond ludicrous i doubt that it even puts out one hundredth of that power even for a real amplifier to put out a true watts its going to cost you to and the unit itself will have a huge transformer weighing to lbs alone besides you couldnt even plug the unit in to a standard wall plug which only gives watts max so just say no to this,"{'neg': 0.137, 'neu': 0.8, 'pos': 0.063, 'compound': -0.6204}",negative

1,this so called slim mount does not allow shifting leftright unless fully extendeddefeating the purpose of a slim mount in most installations if you slide the tv on the mounting bar the bar will tilt or bend and the tv will be tilted toward the heavier side of the bar this contradicts the information advertised on their webpage although they have clarified the description somewhat here on amazon the only way to shift it is to fully extend it from the wall then the wall arms themselves can shift a few inches on the wall plate if you are able to install the mount centered between two studs then perhaps you have no need to shift the tv while in the slim position my studs were only off center of my wall yet my tv is lopsided when i move it a few inches to the center from everything sanus described about this mount at the time i understood the tv could be shifted while in any position not even close i need the tv to be close to the wall due to some near side seating because of this mounts limitations we cant view the tv from those sides the mount os too far from the wall and have the tv centered at the same time i could have purchased a much less expensive slim mount that would have had less limitations than this one this mount did not fit the bill,"{'neg': 0.036, 'neu': 0.95, 'pos': 0.014, 'compound': -0.6482}",negative

1,i was really excited about this speaker but unfortunately this is the worst bluetooth speaker ive ever used the sound quality is clean and crisp has some bass but not a lot the issue seems to be its ability to keep a connection and the alexa support its very buggy and needs work whenever i have my phone paired to the speaker via bluetooth then ask the speaker a question using its builtin alexa feature i hear nothing but hiss and static when i go back to playing music the sound will be from my phone only i have to repair the bluetooth connection i have to do this every time i attempt to ask the speaker a question the alexa feature doesnt seem to work at all if i ask it a question i get seconds of hissing noise they have an android app it appears many people are having issues with their app the rating for their app is quite low with numerous complaints i cant recommend this speaker at the moment perhaps an update will address these issues,"{'neg': 0.096, 'neu': 0.829, 'pos': 0.075, 'compound': -0.7147}",negative

1,ive had a lovehate relationship with harmony for the past yearsbut no more second chancesjust like every harmony ive ever owned setup for this required a call to tech support im fairly tech savvy and this should be easy to set up but it wasnt and i know it wasnt me because it took tech support minutes and syncs to make it function properly yes properly is in quotes because even at its best it was unimpressiveon my own using the software syncing failed to load my activities into the remote and againit took tech support syncs to make it workeven after it was working properly it was still frustrating to use when switching between tv and smart tv it would power the speaker bar on and off does logitech not understand that tv and smart tv are not separate devices and if you are switching from one to the other the sound should be left on with a remote this expensive i shouldnt have to dig out the speaker bar remote to turn it back on every time i switch activities lack of physical buttons for numbers is annoying any time i need the number pad i have to swipe to unlock then swipe to get to the number pad technology is supposed to make processes fasternot slower and yes i know i can turn off the lock featurebut then every time i grab the remote it does something i dont want and that something usually requires timeconsuming troubleshooting as i mentioned before programming this remote is a nightmare hours and even then it couldnt stand alone i ran into problems only tech support could solve and even then it took minutes after i had all the correct devices loaded please note that this was a simple configuration sony smart tvfios dvrsamsung speaker bar all less than years old after i returned this remote i bought a learning remote and endured programming every single button individually and it still took a fraction of the time there is no power button only an off button you turn things on by selecting an activity and as stated beforeswitching to a new activity powers things off that a remote this expensive should understand should be left on if you are going to have a single off button that powers down everything with an activity button that turns everything back on you should have an on button for each device so you can quickly turn on any device that for whatever reason doesnt turn on when you fire up the system with an activity button and againhaving to do an initial swipe to get to the activities just to turn the system on is annoying why does logitech insist on writing code that slows down the poweron process you cannot utilize the harmony software without plugging in the device why when things arent working correctly which is often we should be able to fire up the app just to review the settings then when you do plug the remote in you have to wait for the remote and your pc to establish communication dont software engineers understand that we hate waiting for technology to do things especially when forced to plug in when we dont want to speaking of plugging in it is difficult with this remote first off there is a totally unnecessary door that door gets in the way when youre trying to plug in and plugging in is difficult enough already because the miniusb port is deeply recessed inside the door do we really need to cause all this hassle just to hide a miniusb port cmon logitechdont you guys own cell phones miniusb doors are annoying and useless which is why cell phones stopped using them try to keep up tech support is only good for days based on my experience with this remote and previous harmony remotes this means that any changes i make to my very simple home entertainment system will not work and i will not be able to get help to make them worka remote that costs well over should assimilate my entertainment system like the borg it should be simple to set up function extremely quicklyefficiently and be highly intuitive this device is just another example of technology that steals away hours of your your life that you will never get back,"{'neg': 0.083, 'neu': 0.807, 'pos': 0.11, 'compound': 0.9589}",positive

1,this is my third logitech harmony unit and my last my original was quite good although developed issues when it finally gave up the ghost i replaced it with the next version which had a touch screen and resolved the issues of the original unfortunately that one was destroyed by water damage after a burst pipe i replaced it with the harmony ultimate one and it is absolutely horrible the ergonomics are horrendous it is difficult to use some of the most common buttons without physical gyrations or using two hands in addition the touch screen is so sensitive that you are constantly activating things you dont wanti switched to a new provider went from cable to satellite and the logitech does not fully support the new device including the fact that it wont bring up the numeric pad on the touch screen to enter a channel this means that i still have to resort to the satellite box remote to easily control the boxthe topper is that after just a little over a year just enough time for the warranty to run out the off button no longer works which now makes the remote control completely uselessjust not worth the hassle i truly believe that logitech should develop a new remote that fixes these problems and give one free of charge to anyone that bought the ultimate one its that bad,"{'neg': 0.132, 'neu': 0.777, 'pos': 0.091, 'compound': -0.8886}",negative

1,what a joke because you cant change the way this thing insists on turning every device on and off every time you change activities it is completely worthless for my pretty simple system my receiver takes several seconds about to come on and wont accept commands from the remote before it is booted up which logitech should know so when i use the canned activity watch tv the receiver ends up on the wrong input every time because the harmony is trying to change it before the receiver is ready no problem i think i can add a pause in between the the power on and change input commands right wrong when you go into the customize activity section the built in functions are starred and it explicitly states that you cannot change the default actions only add to them okay maybe i can leave the receiver off of the watch tv program but then i cant control the volume okay maybe theres a way to just tell it to use the receiver volume all the time back over to the customize section nope okay maybe ill create a totally custom watch tv but then the favorites wont work man thats like half the reason i bought this remote oh and it still doesnt handle the power the most basic function of any piece of equipment correctly so that doesnt solve anything oh and by the way the software to load the settings to the remote crashes about one in five time you you use it which bricks the remote and you have to a soft reboot hold the off and menu keys down for seconds and so begins a cascading set of compromises that ultimately renders the logitech harmony one a very incapable universal remote not even as good as one that can be ordered from this very site for about ive played with this thing for a week and the only way i can make any use of it is to use the individual devices means of controlling things like that good old universal one but becaeuse logitech makes the cool features like the favorites dependent on their notion of activities none of that works for me oh and when youre looking at the touch screen for individual devices the button descriptions take up the whole screen sooyou can only see or buttons at a time making that pretty much worthless too well just the icons would do maybe i can get rid of the descriptions back over to the customize section you can change the label but it cant be blank and you still only get one button per line you see where this is going do yourself a favor and stick to the model,"{'neg': 0.059, 'neu': 0.827, 'pos': 0.114, 'compound': 0.9806}",positive

1,i used to be an avid fan of the harmony remote ive owned several in the past but that is no longer the case our ultimate one seemed to work fine at first and we were pleased but over time weve become less and less satisfied something changed over time and now every time we start an activity we need to go to the fix it myself function because there is always one problem or another with one of the devices also the response time of the devices is much slower with the harmony than when using the the remote that comes with the device so for example when you press the playpause button during a fast forward it takes about seconds to respond which forces you to have to rewind which is then also delayed when you try to stop it usually we just end up giving up there is also a problem with the oversensitive recognition of gestures which causes things to happen when we dont want them to and therefore must be undone it has become a frustration to use the harmony remote and we frequently end up just using the remotes that came with the devices sort of defeats the purpose dont you think especially when you consider the cost of this product we tried to resync the harmony remote to see if that would correct some of the issues were having at first the sync ran for hours without completing the message on the remote said not to disconnect because it was in the middle of an update but we finally disconnectedreconnected the remote and the sync finally finished but much to our disappointment all of the problems are still there the only thing we can think of doing now is to delete all of our devices and activities and reenter them since this is timeconsuming and should be unnecessary it only adds to the frustration this is not the kind of pr logitech should want for its product,"{'neg': 0.1, 'neu': 0.825, 'pos': 0.074, 'compound': -0.892}",negative

1,im sorry to say that i thought this remote was junk and am returning it after a few weeks of use i know it looks tempting i know it looks slick its certainly nicely packaged but its a horrible productthe number one thing a remote maker has to get right in my opinion is the ergonomics feel and balance of the unit those of us that watch a lot of tv for better or worse have this thing in our hands a lot of the time and it needs to feel right the ultimate one fails immediately in this regard the weight and balance is just off making it awkward to use the touch screen and gestures and the top buttons which are actually used a lot when watching shows on dvr feel uncomfortable and out of reach the unit feels constantly as though it is tipping forward or back its hard to describe but it just doesnt sit right i have large hands and my wifes hands are pretty small but we both became very frustrated with this remote after trying to use it for a few weeks the fuzzy material on the bottom of the unit is a bad choice too im not sure whether its trying to have a leather like feel but it feels like im holding a loofah i get it that everyone is different but i really feel like logitech who really seems to be the only manufacturer making halfdecent universal remotes needs to go back to the drawing board i just cant believe they tested this on humans before releasing itaside from the ergonomics the buttons are not particularly satisfying the touch screen is not particularly slick i guess we are all spoilt from using iphones ipads and i found more than once having to manually power on my cable box despite having tuned the setup carefully and there being no obstructions between the remote and the device i like the fine tuning ability that you have with logitechs harmony software but it does seem unnecessarily complex sometimes the remote update also seems to take an unnecessarily long timei have absolutely no objection to paying for a universal remote that does what it needs to do and feels good in the hand however this is not that remote not even closelogitech if you are listening get a new design team you can do better than thiswe were replacing a harmony one remote discontinued that became unreliable after a few years but we decided to find a reconditioned one after sending this one backbuyer beware,"{'neg': 0.089, 'neu': 0.793, 'pos': 0.118, 'compound': 0.8903}",positive

1,i never write reviews but i felt i had to for this remote i was the owner of a logitech harmony one for several years prior to purchasing this remote i loved the one it was reliable easy to use and felt nice in the hand i have been using the ultimate one for well a year now and for the price this remote falls shortfirst was the set up logitech switched to a new program so if you were coming over from a previous device you had to start from scratch i feel that everything should have simply imported to the new program this added a good amount of time to the set up the remote itself looks great and is lightweight however it does not feel as ergonomic as the one did it is also lacking the number buttons which makes quickly switching between several channels more time consuming than a traditional remote you have to either scroll through the channels or go through the touch screen to find the channel icon you wantwhen it comes to functionality the remote really falls short i purchased the hub to control my ps the remote constantly loses its pairing with the system i am them forced to get the ps controller and reregister the blu tooth device all over again it defeats the entire purpose of the remote it is also not uncommon for the remote and hub itself to lose their pairing forcing you to either restart the hub or connect the remote to a computer and reset itthe remote also has not had the ability to connect to a ps until recently and it still can not turn the system onoff if i still need to go to the system or use my ps remote what is the use of the universal remote the remote also seems to incorrectly perform the start up or shut down of a process more frequently than my one did making me either press the help button go into the devices and fix it myself or physically get up and turn a component on of offi would have given my one five stars to give you an idea of the step back this remote is for the i paid when it was new including the hub this is a real let downupdate somehow this remote has become even less functional as noted above there is no easy way to change the channel with this remote the icons are now completely useless for example if i want to change to channel i press the icon button because i do not want to scroll through channels and the on screen numbers do not work well the first press will get me next then then then finally im at a channel that i can just scroll to sometimes it never even gets close and i will just scroll through all the channels i make sure to keep the remote pointed directly at the tv and give it time between button presses but nothing works i am changing my review to one star,"{'neg': 0.043, 'neu': 0.864, 'pos': 0.094, 'compound': 0.9807}",positive

2,the logitech harmony ultimate one remote started out as a great product with easy on line programming controls all my devices even older model equipment such as a cd changer there are several serious drawbacks first the remote is rechargeable and thats great if you have an outlet to plug into at your favorite chair otherwise the battery dies without warning it at least should have a low battery alert that gets your attention there are times it seems to loose functionality while it still looks active apparently when losing the charge doesnt turn on all the devices and wont repeat a command see below secondly it is awkward to impossible to use with one hand the touchscreen must be reached across for some controls and can be touched inadvertently the remote has an odd shape and is not comfortable third if you use the remote to turn something on it will not repeat the same command without first choosing another command if for any reason the device changes conditions such as the input source from the condition the remote left it in you must turn it all off or choose another command before you can reuse the first you may think it is locked up even though the touchscreen can be inadvertently touched causing an unwanted command choosing by touching is not that easy especially numbers it has a vibration feedback that takes some getting used to but you better learn to use it or you will have many missed touch commands lastly it does not play well with a directvready tv when operated using that feature using logitech instructions you can get some functionality but plan on a slow process of training individual buttons to individual commands considering the awkwardness of the remote it soon became not worth the trouble logitechs technical support was useless in helping understand or resolve the problems if you are technically savvy you can probably do it yourself but the original remote will be nearby in my experience even when trained the time it takes for the tv to show a picture when choosing to watch tv with the directvready as the input is painfully slow while the tv searches for a genie etcalso the complexity of a smart tv with all the menu options makes using the remote more trouble than it is worth so its great for having replaced several remotes and simplifying commands such as turning on and controlling a cd changer and surround sound system but the functionality and usability for a smart tv and directvready operates as a direct tv mini is a drawback there simply are not enough named button choices for it to be intuitive to use easily i can only recommend it for the ability to turn on the right devices for a particular function such as listen to the radio or watch a dvd its too expensive when you cant do it all with ease,"{'neg': 0.07, 'neu': 0.802, 'pos': 0.128, 'compound': 0.986}",positive

3,i own quite a few different speakers from portable bluetooth speakers to home speakers with integrated voice assistants the ue megablast tries to be the jack of all trades but falls a bit shortunboxingthe unboxing experience is simple and pleasant without getting into too much detail of the packaging youre greeted with a speaker a highquality flat microusb cable and an ac adapter you can also purchase a charging dock separately which will allow you to drop the megablast onto the dock for charging without fiddling with cables additionally you can continue to use the megablast while chargingsetupto setup the megablast i downloaded the ultimate ears app on my smartphone and opened it up after ensuring bluetooth was enabled on my smartphone i turned on the megablast from there you can pair using the app or your phones pairing menu after pairing over bluetooth the app will continue the setup processthe wifi connectivity setup process is simple but only if your home network situation is typical ultimate ears recommends having separate ssids for each network eg mywifi ghz mywifi ghz so that the megablast doesnt get confused during setup i found that following this recommendation led to a successful setup for the wifi connectivity after selecting your network and entering the password youre also given the opportunity to login to amazon alexa for the voice assistant functionality the app will also install any firmware updates during this processapponce the setup is complete the app is very simple you have the ability to turn off the microphone for alexa to work and you have the ability to see the battery status wifi connection status bluetooth connection status and alexa signin status you also have the ability to switch wifi networks switch amazon accounts for alexa integration or unpairforget the megablast lastly you can change the idletime before shutdown the speaker language and toggle firmware autoupdatesmegablast hardwarethe megablast is pretty simple it has a power button with an led in it a pairing button and volume downup buttons and of course the degree sound people love so much paired with an ip water resistance rating for splashes and even a bit of submersion however it does not have a mm jacka feature found on the smaller ue boomaudio qualitylike the boom speakers that preceded it the megablast has sparkly highs clear midrange and punchy bass however the megablast starts to fall short at the highest volumes as compression kicks in to prevent clippingdistortion in the bass frequencies this is due to the fact that the eq really pushes the bass on the megablast but like any other bluetooth speaker it can only physically handle so muchso to prevent damage it compresses the bass at a certain threshhold when this happens the bass sounds either anaemic or uncontrolled i do want to stress that this happens to most portable bluetooth speakers and the megablast far from the worst of themdespite this if youre listening to spacious dynamic music then the megablast will sound fantastic at most volumes i have gotten the chance to listen to progressive rock metal acoustic swing jazz big band jazz edm and more music with more dynamic instrumentation really shines on the megablast music with a constantly hot master may start to lose its clarity when the megablast is set to its highest volumes but overall an excellent listening experiencealexa integrationim not a fan of alexa personally i find that switching between bluetooth and alexa is not seamless once i call out alexa the megablast disconnects from bluetooth so i have to pair my phone again if i want to use it despite this you can use alexa with a limited number of unpopular streaming services you can control alexas volume but not your bluetooth volume you also cant ask for the battery status using alexa it helps to think of alexa as a standalone assistant that knows nothing of its existent in the megablast when using alexa the megablast is irrelevant it only knows whatever alexa knows and can only do whatever alexa can doexcept stream from spotify for some reason so the lesson here is that if you are using alexa dont expect bluetooth connectivity to resume just stick to alexas amazon music iheartradio and tunein streaming over wifi oh and just so were clear alexa only works over wificonclusion final thoughtsso is it worth the price im not sure i own portable bluetooth speakers in the same price range and the megablast packs a better sound and more volume but its alexa integration is halfbaked and its missing the integrated voice that tells the battery status when you hold both the volume up and down buttons at the same time on top of that you cant do party mode with multiple megablasts you cant do remote power on and you cant change the eq these are all features of the smaller ue boom so im rather confused as to why these features arent available on the megablast if youre buying this speaker for the alexa integration forget it but if you want a great bluetooth speaker with a few missing features compared to its smaller siblings this could be the one to rock your parties,"{'neg': 0.043, 'neu': 0.833,

3,the best part about this speaker is alexa and the connectivity of smart devices the sound is crisp and clear even at max level but the bass is minimal at best at very low volumes the bass actually sounds pretty decent the audio resonates very well from this speaker and its difficult to pinpoint exactly where the sound is coming from which is great projects well and is very clear when playing audio with alexa everything functions beautifully but connect to bluetooth and you will wish for a headphone jack on your phone range is great but connecting and staying connected is a pain i am hoping a firmware update will fix this since i think this has plenty of potential the life proofing is great and makes this an ideal outdoor speaker,"{'neg': 0.059, 'neu': 0.598, 'pos': 0.342, 'compound': 0.995}",positive

3,we bought this hoping to get the best of both worlds of amazon echo and bluetooth speaker it does great at the latter but only ok at the formersetup was super easy but had to be done thru an app i dont believe there was any other way to set it up as a speaker it sounds incredible we used it at a birthday party in a medium to large space and it easily filled the room things got a little tinny when we tried to see how loud it would go but in good news it went really loud where this speaker fails is as an echo replacement there is no way to leave it plugged in to use as a constant alexa option the charging port is on the bottom under a weather proof flap and the cord isnt flexible enough to allow you to flip it back over and stand up regular its really meant to be a portable speaker at which it does excel but then the other issue with using it as a portable speaker for alexa is that it auto powers off after minutes of no activity or use so unless youre paying music constantly or asking alexa to tell you the weather or stock prices every minutes you have to power the thing on to ask alexa something far less than idealso its because of the latter issue with alexa being barely functional well be returning it and buying an actual echo,"{'neg': 0.046, 'neu': 0.809, 'pos': 0.145, 'compound': 0.9801}",positive

3,this thing had great sounding audio and great battery life setup was super easy and the firmware update was quick which is great the big but is that the alexa feature is hampered by a less sensitive microphone than that of the echo dot the dot microphone is just much more sensitive and works more reliably there is also no standard mm audio aux jack if you dont care about the two flaws then this is a great but expensive device if two flaws make you think twice then just get something else,"{'neg': 0.058, 'neu': 0.776, 'pos': 0.166, 'compound': 0.8875}",positive

3,to start off sound is super objective to the individual listening so im not saying im a sound aficionado just going to tell you how it sounds to me first thing that you need to talk about with this unit is the unboxing experience the manufacturer made it a fun experience with a quality feeling everything once you get past that you see all its features and i was excited i booted mine while it was on its wireless charger to find my first pro and con alexa is great if you have amazon music which to be fair logitech gives you a trail of it to get you started i dont listen to my music from amazon and didnt like that i was forced into because my music service was not supported asking basic things like paus stop or next track are fun but i noticed that when i used the alexa side it disconnected the bluetooth side every single time so i stopped using it for that and just focused on sound quality unfortunately this was a tall order on this unit i felt the sound had a incredible amount of treble which hurt me even at volume my phone luckily supports a great equalizer built in and i tweaked it to sound good but not great for how much you invest in a unit like this i felt like they fell short it has a lot of things to love like the basic waterproofing it offers and wireless charging to make everything super simple but to me those are coolgimmicky to summarize if water proof speaker is what your looking for with wireless charging then i would say this is probably the best one if your looking for the best sound you can get i would say maybe something elsethank you for taking the time to read my review and i hope it helped a little in your decision good luck,"{'neg': 0.073, 'neu': 0.72, 'pos': 0.208, 'compound': 0.9951}",positive

3,i am using the gpx in a small commercial kitchen it is a foregone conclusion that the acoustics are horrendous moreover there are oven hoods stoves and hot and cold tables whooshing and rattling machines spinning and making egregious screeching noises fans blowing buzzers doorbells and phones going off and people shouting and cursing at each other and etcthe gpx has pretty good overall sound reproduction quality and plenty of volume even in this less than ideal setting the volume control is stepless and increments in single values from of course somebody had to mash it all the way up within seconds of the thing being plugged in with some kind of pantera or slipknot or ratm crap it sounded very loud very good and there was no discernible clipping or distortion this lasted only a few seconds as it was much too loud which is a good thing and we settled on for the rest of night as loud as possible while still being able to communicate using raised voices which everyone has to do anyway to be understood irrespective of any superficial tertiary electronically engendered harmonic dissonancei was allocated a budget of usd and the only other unit i considered was the samsung mx js for around usd because it had so many reviews however again and again i heard people complaining about the lack of bass so i decided to go with the gpx because it had a dedicated inch subwooferthe only space i have available is on top of one of the coolers about feet above the ground i know from past experience that subwoofer placement can have a significant effect on the amount of bass that is output but floor space is at a premium and even if there was a corner of the floor available the proprietary cords that connect the head unit to all three speakers preclude the use of any normal monster cable extensionperhaps it is because the subwoofer is high above the ground and not near a corner but i am really disapointed with the low frequency bass response granted i didnt have very high expectations for an all in one shelf stereo priced at circa usd but i was hopeful read naive that the dedicated inch subwoofer this unit touted which differentiated it from its peers would deliver some facsimile of accurate bass responseunfortunately at least in my location and application the low end just isnt there at all contrariwise there is some weak muddy midrange and high range bass to be sure but i know the music i like well enough to really miss the low thunderous bass hits that should drop i tried out some pac only god can judge me now and wonda why they call u bitchsic some stevie ray vaughan riviera paradise little wing and chitlins con carne some bob marley time will tell and some ratatat songs from the album classicsall of these songs have some nice low frequency bass that hits you in the chest and rattles the walls and windows when it drops on a system with a capable subwoofer but i did not hear any of the lowest bass while using this gpx by way of comparison another system i owned was comprised of some affordable recertified harman kardon separates ie a channel receiver for usd two bookshelf speakers for usd and a inch powered subwoofer for usd and while certainly not spectacular i could at least hear the lowest of the low bass i am of the opinion that you really cant get a decent subwoofer for under or usd so i had no delusions about that recertified stuff but it was in my price range and whilst it didnt play the lowest notes very loud they were definitely audiblewith the gpx i just didnt hear the notes from entire frequency ranges at the low end i do not know the exact cutoff at the low end where it can no longer reproduce the notes but if you have ever used winamp and played around with its band equalizer where the lowest slider is hz and the highest is khz then you may grasp that what i am speculating is that nothing below say hz or hz or somewhere around there is being reproducedfor frame of reference i listen to most of my music on a pair of sennheiser hd headphones with lossless flac shn or wav source output through winamp and i always finetune winamps band eq into a sort of v shape with the lowest and highest sliders almost at max and then each slider between those two progressively lower such that the slider for khz in the very middle is almost all the way down at the center of the v shapeand what i can tell you is that the low notes in these songs i mentioned those which are below the hz nd lowest slider on the eq all hit hard and boomy and sound great on my headphones and as such i anticipated hearing those notes from the inch subwoofer on the gpx but they just werent there i should point out that when using the gpx in this kitchen in addition to the sub optimal placement of the subwoofer i am also not using a lossless audio source nor am i playing it through winamp and its band eqeverybody just puts on youtube videos which i believe are all manner of lossy and that flash or html player or whatever it is has no equalizer that i am aware of and of course the left and right audio composite patch cord running from the computer to the gpx is not gold plated low guage or nitrogen purged etc etc ad nauseam ad infinitum ergo these shortcomings are indubitably degrading the sound qualitywhat i have done though is to make sure that sonys bass boost which on this unit they call bass bazuka or some inane crap is turned on and it does in fact make a very noticeable difference when it is off there is absolutely no low end at all when it is on there is a decentish amount of muddy midrange and high range bassthis unit also has a dedicated control to adjust the level of the subwoofer itself from db and i have this as high as it will go there are also around built in eq presets available which i have tried in an effort to get the bass to hit you know that feeling you get in your chest when the bass drops but i still am not hearing the lowest notesit also has a custom eq setting which consists of only three bands that are not labeled with their numerical hz value only low mid and high i have manually set this as close as possible to the v shape i use in winamp with the low and high at max and the mids near minimum and this is the configuration i used to test the songs i mentionedas far as build quality goes the sony gpx is very plasticky and extremely lightweight for its size now maybe headunit and speaker technology has changed since the time i picked up that hk stuff but i was surprised at how light the speakers and headunit were considering their size and cost maybe the weight of the magnet is no longer a necessary and sufficient variable to solve the equation for qualityall of the controls on this thing are ridiculously oversized chintzy and not particularly tactile or sturdy feeling i guess you could say they are all soft touch type buttons that have a lot of give it has a decent size display with graphics that look like something out of an alpine car audio headunit from the volume nob is the size of a grapefruit for some unknown reason much too bigthe face of the headunit and the cone of each speaker and the subwoofer all have led lighting the color and pattern of which can be changed or disabled entirely honestly i would prefer it if sony had reallocated the costs accrued by this gimmicky nonessential lightshow into higher quality audio components on the headunit and speakers in an effort to provide better audio quality at the same costone of the selling points for us was that this unit was bluetooth and near field communication capable and somebody figured out how to get their phone to talk to it pretty easily so now they can control basically all the settings and choose the music at the cost of their data plan it also comes with a small remote that is seemingly bereft of a mute button but replete with two aaa batteriesas stated previously the speaker wires are a too short ie ft maybe idk b have no speaker posts and c use a proprietary connector that looks more like an ethernet jack than any elsesomething else i noticed and again maybe this is just the way speakers have evolved is that the actual woofer cones on the speakers and subwoofer do not move at all when music is playing the cones on every other set of speakers i have owned move in and out in time with the notes and the distance traveled increases in direct proportion to the volume levelall in all i would say that if you dont care about low frequency bass assuming that my inability to properly locate the subwoofer on the floor in a corner is not entirely responsible then you would be pretty happy with this unit because it does sound reasonably nice and has plenty of volume pretty flashing lights bluetooth eq presets and a rudimentary custom eq and yes it looks sleek and black and shiny and sexy from the front the particle board from the rear is a little disconcertingnotwithstanding the veracity of that antiquated adage re breaking speakers in effects an amelioration of thier phonic capabilities headphone freaks swear by this but i didnt notice anything change with mine i will be unequivocally verklempt if after a few weeks of hour per day

3,in theory these are a really great set of overtheear headphones they combine wireless bt connectivity with the option for wired active noise cancellation with ambient aware lets you let in a certain amount of outside sound a cool sounding built in calibration technology and its all made by a wellrespected brand name in audio in execution it doesnt quite live up to what i would have expected for there are better and less expensive options out there they dont sound bad and the build quality is great but im of the opinion that they arent worth the pricefirst the good theyre easy to set up and pair with your device they are solidly constructed they are fairly comfortable initially for how heavy they are and the ear cups are contoured nicely for a better fit around your ear out of the box they sound acceptable and once you download the app and tweak the eq it starts sounding much better especially once you turn off the noise cancellationbut there are so many little annoyancesthese are not something that id ever choose to bring out in public for being a wireless mobile device theyre really bulky they dont start off uncomfortable at all but they get there after about minutes of use you will notice the heat and if you have a sensitive head crown pressurejbl harman touts a technology called trunote that supposedly analyzes the position of the drivers in relation to your ears making the sound better due to personalization this is run through the app you put the headphones on run trunote which plays one quick tone similar to an audessey autoeq setup on a denon receiver takes a few seconds to calibrate and then moves on i cant say that i noticed a dramatic difference between when i ran it and when i didntspeaking of the aforementioned app you have to download it in order to optimize your listening experience it allows you to do several things including running trunote turning noise cancelation onoff and tweaking the ambient aware eq settings the one that will likely get the most usage is turning the noise cancelation off and tweaking the eqnote i said turn noise cancelation off the sound quality improves fairly dramatically with it off in my opinion its average execution of noise cancelation so its worth it to have off the ear cups provide ample noise isolation as it is but if youre going to pay for noise cancelation you should be able to use it without affecting the sound negativelythe eq is where youll get the most dramatic performance increase as it allows you to adjust bands each total of bands within the low medium and high frequency sound spectrum in fact i would say this is absolutely essential in order to get the most out of the headphones as mentioned earlier they sound acceptable out of the box but lack some kick out of the bass and the mids start to get tinny when increasing the volume there are presets and then you can customize and save different personal settings i like all of this in theory different eq settings for different types of music is great but objectively a common listener may not want to mess with thisespecially since you have to open the app every time to do this and to be clear you dont have to open the app to get the headphones to work but you have to open the app to take advantage of the noise cancelation the eq etcits great that you can use the headphones wired when they run out of power this also increases the sound quality but what happens when you want to use them wired and still have power and want to use the app to have access to the eq that does not seem possible once you go wired it defaults to shutting off the bluetooth connection and if you reconnect it defaults to sending sound wirelesslywhen youre not listening to music you can use the headphones for phone calls call quality is averagefinally its worth mentioning a couple sets of controls on the back of the left and right cups on the left there are volume controls playpause on the right there is the bluetooth powerconnect button and a smart button that is assignable via the app to either adjusting the level of ambient aware low medium high or noise cancelation onoff these are great and convenient additions but you have

3,are they there yet nope still a pretty big a bite to setup that has not changed much since i first started using the harmony one eight or nine years ago and still use it that model i have no idea why it still works it has been dropped stepped on kicked across the floor my dog chewed on it and it has came apart at the seams i snap and bend it back into place and it still works that is just amazing to me now to the remote at hand harmony ultimate one irok what that means is that this is the version that does not have the remote hub that allows you to use the radio frequency to control tech in the next room though walls or in cabinets you can get the remote hub separately here on amazon and i will be getting that because i am so tired at looking at all the receivers players and crap i just cant stand it any longer i want a clean look invisible techthe harmony ultimate can control up to devices and logitech has a library of nearly a quarter million different home entertainment products and their respective infrared commands even if your hdtv or bluray player is obscure youll probably be able to control it with this remotethe downside on the buttons is that it has nothing to do with previous versions of harmony remotes so now you have to relearn the pattern you were used to if you are first time harmony customer no big deal the only thing i have heard if you get the hub and i have personally not experienced this is that the hub may need to be reset from time to timeyou control all your devices with one remote now and be able to make totally customizable control layouts and multidevice macros then this harmony one ultimate will bend to your will you just need a bit of patience and determination plus a touch of imagination to turn this remote into anything you need a remote to be it may take you some time to sit down and put all the entries in heck this thing can even control lighting and window blinds if thats your thingin the end i love touch screens it makes everything so much more like your phone and if you get the hub you can control your tech programed into the harmony ultimate from your phone with the downloadable apppain in the butt to program great user experience if you have the patience and tenacity to put in what you need to control is that easy no if you have trouble doing technical things let your kid do it for you or find a twelve year old and bet them ten bucks they cant program itmission accomplished if you have read these reviews on amazon look into the negative reviews and you will most likely see that a logitech representative is reaching out to the reviewer to help them with a direct email or phone link i like to see this from companiesupdate i find the right chanel toggle and left volume toggle too low on the remote for comfortable use the remote is already shorter than the harmony one so that part is not ergonomic at all remote should be longer or they should have moved the toggles higher on remote,"{'neg': 0.047, 'neu': 0.838, 'pos': 0.115, 'compound': 0.9898}",positive
3,i want to love this remote but i just cant we got this for a great price and i debated on keeping it or not and finally decided to keep it it is ok but not near as good as the harmony one in my opinion the touch screen is a great idea but really easy to hit things that you do not want to because it is right in the middle of the remote i think it would have made more sense to put it at the top and have all the fixed buttons at the bottom like the harmony one and then you would not have to reach over the touch screen to get to some frequently used buttons and accidentally hit the touchscreen the layout of the buttons also does not seem as intuitive as older harmony remotes in my opinion and maybe that is more because i am used to the older layouts maybe if you are new to harmony with this remote it would not be as big of a deal or noticeable for youi also do not like that the bottom of the remote is curved so that it will rock from side to side with only a slight touch or movement when on a table or tv tray i think it only hit the deck once so far and it did not cause any damage but it is a significant concern with hard floors when you have a remote this expensive all the other harmony remotes that i have had did not have this issue one it may be of no concern if you have plush carpeted floorsi did like that the newer harmony software would automatically have all the channels available to pick favorites and it puts the icon for network on the touch screen this was pretty slick and in older remotes there was no easy way to do thisi also do like that the charger puts the remote vertical and takes up a much smaller footprint it is also much easier to see if the remote is in the charge from across the room the thing i do not like is i feel the battery life is much lower than either the harmony one or the both discontinued i have to charge it much more often,"{'neg': 0.039, 'neu': 0.76, 'pos': 0.201, 'compound': 0.9973}",positive

4,i installed this for use with a sony kdlhx a model about years old and weighing less than pounds this mount is what is found when using the sanus website mountfinder for this model most of the one star detraction is my fault but ill let sanus share the star because this mount doesnt really have the rotation that i needed i didnt specifically look at the rotation spec my fault but its only degrees even using a tv thats at the very low end of the size spec this is a pretty low value and it would be nice to find different models of mounts that feature different specs for different needs this one is touted to be super slim and indeed it is which i needed due to placement in a walkway to a door going for this feature sacrificed rotation evidently the feature of moving laterally is nice but of dubious value except in very specific circumstancesthe other specs of degree tilt seems to be about actual performance but the extension from wall value is speced at but was actually the tilt mechanism was the only poor performer even with the tension completely released the sider binds at about tilt adding a light coat of lithium grease didnt help it will achieve full tilt with a firmer jiggle but it really should be smooth as silkone outstanding feature is a heavy paper vinyl coated template for marking the wall many time companies provide newspaper weight templates which are not stiff enough to get a reliable mark this template is also dead on for hole locationall the other aspects of the mount are excellent i have no doubt it would hold full value of weight specified and is constructed with no corners cut on quality the instructions are good and the installation process is well documented with illustrations and correct the only thing that could be better for installation is the screw selection provided two different lengths of m m and m screws are provided for attaching the rails to the tv depending on how the back of your tv is constructed for my tv the m mm was way to short with a short spacer and not quite long enough with the mm and a long spacer for my tv something in between and would allow more threads engaged in the tvso bottom line is that its almost perfect for what the specs are but it would be nice if sanus would provide all mounts that would fit rather than just onekudos to amazon as well the price dropped from to two days after my order one call of minutes resulted in the credit of,"{'neg': 0.099, 'neu': 0.748, 'pos': 0.153, 'compound': 0.9858}",positive

4,ultimate ears megablast smart portable wifi and bluetooth speaker is definitely a contender for one of the best bluetooth speakers ive ever heard the sound is crisp clear and loud louder than any other speaker i feel like ive tested the nice thing about the speaker is that even though it reaches unreached levels of sound it doesnt get too blown out at the higher levels sometimes static and fuzz can occur and i hear none of it like the new bose speakers the sound is projected in a circular fashion which i absolutely love being able to hear the music from any part of the room as if you were right next to it is a great accomplishment the packaging on the speaker is slick and the unit itself is very robust and heavy i like the fact that the speaker is waterproof but it will be a while before i put that to the test the only real thing that bugged me about the speaker is the app that the company forces you to use to setup the device i had issues getting it to recognize the speaker installing the updates and even pairing with wifi repeatedly i had to restart the app and sometimes it just would not pair with the device at all finally i just got it to pair with bluetooth and turned off the app so as of now i dont use the alexa function i dont really use alexa so its not a big deal to me but the hassle from the app itself makes me not even want to try and finish the process so that to me is the only real detriment to the device other than that i think it is a great quality speaker that competes with any of the other bluetooth speakers ive heard out in todays market you cant go wrong with this one but i hope they update and fix the bugs in the app soon cause it hurts the experience,"{'neg': 0.016, 'neu': 0.874, 'pos': 0.11, 'compound': 0.9778}",positive

4,the speaker is amazing ue makes great products and the megablast is no different quality all the way around from the packaging to the build quality to the overall sound a across all of those areas the only thing that left me wanting more was the bass from a speaker this size i was sort of disappointed in the quality of the bassmy unit came with the speaker and the table top charging dock the packaging is incrdible and makes sure your product is not going to be damaged in any way during deliveryshipping to cable charge you simply plug in the supplied usb cable into the bottom of the unit to charge with the docking station you simply screw in a charging station cap on the bottom and place directly on top of the charger the initial charge took quite a long time and was not fully charged from the factory but once charged the battery life has been great ue says a full charge can last hours and if you download and connect to the ue app you can always see how much charge you have left so youre not stuck with a dead speaker at the wrong timesetting up the speaker was super fast and simple normal bluetooth pairing was immediate to my note i downloaded the ue app as well and while it looks polished it felt sort of glitchy the app recognized the speaker immediately but had trouble running through the rest of the setup i had to exit the app and start over twice before it let me finish the setup not a huge deal to be concerned with as im sure ue will fix the app over time its also nice that the speaker can be connected via wifi and bluetooth and you can set it to update itself via wifi automaticallysetting up alexa was also a breeze simply go to the alexa setup in the app and login with your amazon alexa account and thats it alexa is immediately available on your megablast we also have a few amazon echos in the home and using the megablast with alexa felt the same as using the echo device speech recognition was very good even from across the room all the features of alexa are right here in the megablast and portable unlike a echoecho plus i think well use the megablast so much more simply because we can move it around with usbuild quality is amazing the speaker is huge and feels very sturdy and almost heavy in the hand very nice the degrees sound field is also great and you get room filling sound and great volume levels sound quality is also very good as youd expect from ue but from a speaker of this size and build i honestly expected more bass i have numerous bluetooth speakers some bigger or smaller some from ue and other brands compared to all my other speakers the megablast was just ok on bass response dont get me wrong the bass is there and for most its probably fine however when listening to bass heavy audio even when eqd the bass simply gets compressed and tight not boomy i dont think it would be a reason to not get the megablast the overall sound of the speaker is amazing but if you were thinking that a speaker this size would give you over the top bass you might be disappointed having ip weather sealing is nice so you dont have to be worried about getting it weta couple things i wish they would have done better you cannot pair multiple megablast speakers together in stereo which for this price and category seems to be a glaring omission i hope ue fixes that soon i also wish that the speaker came with a mm connector but it does not wireless all the way or nothing when using alexa the only way you know alexa has been triggered is if youre actually looking at the speaker and can see the led light on top grow brighter there is no audible tone that tells you alexa is ready like when using an amazon alexa deviceall in all the ue megablast is an amazing speaker with amazing features and integrating alexa just kicks it up a notch im very impressed with the megablast overall,"{'neg': 0.041, 'neu': 0.783, 'pos': 0.176, 'compound': 0.9989}",positive
4,ive used multiple bluetooth speakers in my years and i would say that the megablast rates right up there in the topthe most important feature to me off the bat is the music quality i listen primarily to classic rock and heavy metal and the highs on the output were very crisp the bass was very punchy and pronounced but i felt at times that the the low end wasnt filling in on louder volumes full disclosure i tend to listen to music loudwhen i listened to acoustic songs the crisp sound sounded beautiful and it was a very pleasurable experiencethe unit structure itself is incredible solid i like when electronics have a dense feel the only thing i would say is that it actually packs some weight behind it i also found the battery life to be phenomenalthe app itself is a little cumbersome in the flow of things while using an iphone and other apps didnt stream out like instagram videos but maybe theres a little more tweaking i have to go throughthis is the first time that uve really used alexa and i have to say i just might try it more and more the microphone picked up my voice pretty easily even while playing music at my high volunes which was a huge plusoverall i recommend anyone looking for a solid and rugged base nice sounding music and especially if you are hooked into amazons alexa,"{'neg': 0.015, 'neu': 0.82, 'pos': 0.165, 'compound': 0.9898}",positive

4,this is an allaround great speaker but i cant give it five stars when it doesnt stream pandora or spotify yes it still works fine as a bluetooth speaker but the main reason for getting the wificapable speaker is the ability to stream music without a phone sure you need wifi to use the alexa integration but to me thats secondary supposedly other services will be added in the future but at the time of this review neither of my favorites would streaminitial setup was a little janky i downloaded the wrong app at first since there are multiple ue apps but after connecting via bluetooth my iphone prompted me to download the correct one i could have saved that initial search and incorrect download by connecting first i also had issues connecting over my wifi at work it initially connected fine but when i went through the immediate firmware upgrade it couldnt reconnect because it said wep was unsupported i did the update over my phones hotspot then it was able to reconnect to my work wifi one nice thing about the degree sound output is that if you dont like looking at the giant plus and minus symbols on the front of the speaker you can just turn those toward the wall and it still sounds great i personally recommend getting the charging base otherwise the charging port is awkward to get to if you want to leave it plugged in and charging,"{'neg': 0.071, 'neu': 0.813, 'pos': 0.116, 'compound': 0.9216}",positive

4,i own a google home and i have played around with an amazon echo at my local best buy both are really good personal assistant devices but i was frankly underwhelmed by each devices audio quality particularly when it comes to music playback as a result i was excited to get the ultimate ears megablast with the expectation of exceptional sound quality the megablast come nicely packaged and includes a power adapter a usb cable and some basic instructions you need the ultimate ears app from either the apple app store or the google play store to complete setup within the app one simply connects the megablast to your wifi network pair bluetooth devices and sign into your amazon account and youre up and running cant beat that for simplicity i started off by asking alexa some standard personal assistant questions like the time and weather then quickly moved on to music i have an amazon music unlimited account so i start requesting songs i pump up the volume using the control on the side of the device and im quickly blown away by the sound quality emanating from the megablast i put it through it paces by requesting various music selections from rock to jazz to classical what a treat great music reproduced with great quality by simply asking alexa deep bass and clean rich highs filled my house even on the max volume there was no distortion this thing rocks one disappointment i discovered which you should be aware of if you use amazon music unlimited amazon offers a reduced pricing option called amazon echo monthly which limits your account to just one echo device it appears that this plan is only available on echo devices and not on licensed devices such as the megablast i hope this changes in the future since amazon support was even surprised that it didnt work i should point out another discovery that the megablast powers off when not in use i thought initially that this was a disappointing limitation for a personal assistant device until i found the setting in the app to change this auto sleep feature in time increments of minutes minutes hour hours or never you will get hours of constant use on the never sleep setting impressive buyers should note that ultimate ears also sells a great charging dock accessory for the megablast called the ultimate ears power up this lets you leave it on at all time while also maintaining a full charge for when you want to take the megablast with you when you do the unit is big but is still quite portable i was happy to learn that the megablast is also water resistant not only that but you could immerse in water up to feet deep for minutes why you would want to submerge such an expensive device is beyond me but hey you can if you want as i used the device for several days one issue stood out while the magablast boasts a multiple microphone design with beam forming technology i found myself constantly repeating myself to get alexa to respond very frustrating im hoping that this is improved with a firmware update other than this one issue i was truly impressed by the ultimate ears megablast i would definitely recommend particularly for music lovers seeking excellent sound quality,"{'neg': 0.038, 'neu': 0.778, 'pos': 0.184, 'compound': 0.9981}",positive
4,i own and have used the ultimate ears boom speaker that ive had for the past years or so and it has been my favorite bluetooth speaker ive ever had after hearing about this new ulimate ears megablast speaker i was thrilled and couldnt wait to receive it in the mail i knew this would be my new permanent replacment for my aging boom speaker with the increasingly dwindling battery but a few bugs and inconsistencies keep it from exceeding my expectations itll still be my new dailyuse speakerfirst of all let me explain why the original ue boom was my favorite speaker ive got some hearing loss issues and my right ear has only about hearing its really only good for picking up bass lol so when i choose a new speaker or pair of headphonesearbuds they have to be able to get loud enough for a comfortable level for me but yet even louder when i want to crank it i use all my bluetooth devices on my ipad pro and my new iphone x the boom speaker has never failed me i watch twitchtv daily usually for about hours on average while i do my work ive used my boom for many years like this and ive only kept the volume up between the notch this is maybe the max volume on the device volume bar for everything i listen to and never had an issue hearingso i was definitely excited to get this i couldnt wait to unbox it get it charged and synced to my devices lets break it downpackagingthis was where i was most impressed the packaging on the outside didnt look like anything fancy but its when you break the seal and pull the slipcover off the box the inside box the speaker is housed in is made of a super thick and durable cardboard and i was totally not expecting the amazing artwork its so bright and colorful and i immediately thought theyve put a lot of love into this making and designing this speaker and box inside the box the cylindrical speaker is nestled in perfectly curved black styrofoam and matches everthing else its very snug and secure along with the speaker you also get the normal minimal instructions its a bluetooth speaker not rocket science usb power cable and the largerthanmyoldone power brick the cable and brick are both white perfectly contrasting with the black speakerdesignthis speaker looks nearly identical to my old one aside from a few minor color differences and the obvious fact that it is much bigger the top of the speaker has the power button and the bluetooth sync button on the front nonmesh part of the speaker are the and buttons for the volume then down at the very bottomon the bottom lies the flipup waterproofing rubber flap you have to pull this up in order to get to the usb charge port and power led charge indicators this flap was a little tighter to pull up than i would have liked i thought i was going to rip it once and you definitely have to pull it back a bit with some force in order to plug the charge cable into it the only other negative to this is given the fact that all this is on the bottom of the speaker you have the lay it down on its side while it is charging again the same as my old one butyou know round thingswell they roll aside from this i absolutely love the tall cylinder shape of the speaker and the minimal amount of space it takesapponce i got the speaker fully charged i was able to connect it via bluetooth to my ipad pro my primary twitchtv watching device without fail i downloaded the app designed for the blast range of speakers it looks really nice and has all the normal options id expect the app detected the speaker and after i entered my wifi password it even automatically updated the firmware it then asked me to activate alexa and log into my amazon account which i was able to do without any problemsthen gave me a code for a few months free of amazon music i use spotify myself but still not a bad gesture after the inital setup the app displays the current battery level in a barstyle format not a percentage confimration of wifi connection and alexa onoff as well as the link to my amazon account other than that its pretty basic but gives you the information you needhowever my major issue with the battery level on this speaker is that you can only view it through the app my old boom speaker displayed the battery at the top of my device as well as in my battery widget this speaker does neither it just shows that headphone icon at the top of my device with no battery indicator and does not appear anywhere in my batteries info in settings or the widget im hoping this is just a software bug and will be fixed in a later update as its quite annoying coming from my boom speaker that does show this then again it could be intentional since you can just ask alexa whats my battery atbluetoothalexasoundim tying these final three into one category because its seems that they are all somehow related together and where my biggest concerns are this is where the the bugs and inconsistencies hide aside from my issue with the battery indicator above the bluetooth has excellent range but it doesnt appear to be flawless like im used to with other ultimate ear products when it has a connection its great and solid no cutouts or any other weird sound artifacts however ive had a few instances where the bluetooth connection would just drop for no reason this seemed a little inconsistent with no rhyme or reason for it completely random i have to manually go into settings and select the megablast speaker to connect it againthis is my first alexa enabled device so i was definitly excited to give it a try initially alexa was a joy to use i started with all the obvious stuff you would ask something like alexa or siri hows the weather today granted me exactly what i wanted to hear plus more in a voice that i found rather pleasing compared to say siri alexa just seems much more natural and nonrobotic then i go on with having her tell me a joke rap etc etc all works great buti discovered an issue with using alexa while playing music or any audio already coming through the speaker when the speaker is playing audio and you issue an alexa commandwhen shes donethe bluetooth connection justdrops every single time i have to go into settings and reconnect so the only time i can use alexa is when the speaker isnt being used which then ive more than likely got it turned of very disheartening as i really wanted to implement alexa into my music smart thermostat etc im really hoping this is just a bug and canwill be fixed in a soonerthanlater firmware updateas for sound i found a lot of inconsistencies there as well when playing music or other audio i noticed i had to turn this speaker up louder than my boom to get the same level of volume out of it i have to use my megablast at about half volume to get it at the same sound level as volume of my boom which is weird becauseisnt this supposed to be the loudest speaker they offer it appears this speaker does better at mid to higher level volumes than lower to mid level i initially thought that the max volume of the speaker was independant of the volume i have on my device because i could say alexa change the volume to and the volume bar on my device would stay the same but the speaker would be much louder but thenwhen i raise or lower the volume a notch on the device the speaker volume would change to match that another issue i noticedthe speaker outputs the audio that is being playedbut none of my other device sounds unlike my boom i dont cant hear the keyboard typing sound any text or email notification sounds etc ive even turned the sounds volume on my device up to the max with no results but the audio being played is normal i cannot figure this out to save my lifei didnt get to test the bluetooth phonecall quality during use because my brand new iphone x that ive had for less than days decided to bite the dust on me the touch screen quit workinghardware defect and im currently awaiting a replacement from my carrierconclusionso there you have it so far i have a lovehate relationship with this speaker the volume inconsistencies are killing me and alexa is all but useless since my bluetooth connection drops every time i use her i also really with there was a battery level displayed on the device like my boom has but the only way to see it with the megaboom is via the app these are my big issues with the speaker and why im giving it a out of stars the only thing saving it from stars is the amazing sound of the actual audio that is being playedas long as its above half on the volume levelnow i did reach out to logitech the manufacturer of the ultimate ears brand on twitter earlier in the week several days have passed since then which is why i waited a bit on my review and i havent heard anything back from them ill email support about this i guess when i get my phone back but i really expected some sort of response or followup from them regarding this oh well i should dock a star for this but i wont,"{'neg': 0.043, 'neu': 0.831, 'pos': 0.126,

at the party and everywhere in between whats in the boxa box with a lot of funky and groovy art youll know what i mean when you slide off the tame looking coverue megablast speakerquick start guidemicro usb cableusb chargerappearance and build quality the all cylindrical design looks very similar to an oversize beer can with a rugged rubberized exterior shell to handle all the scrapes bruising and drops that will occur over its lifetime the speaker is covered in a hard fabriclike grill to allow the audio to pass through the two mm tweeters two mm drivers and two mm x mm passive radiators all the while keeping dust moisture and water from seeping into the interior on the bottom of the speaker is a circular rubber cover protecting the micro usb port for charging there is also a removable dring underneath the speaker i assume this dring is for hanging the speaker up top is the power button and another much smaller button to enable bluetooth pairing the very oversized buttons are located along the sides of the cylinder the button labels for and are huge youd have to be blind not to notice them and maybe it is just me but they do have the visual appearance of resembling a religious cross featuresrugged design take the speaker anywhere indoors and outdoors but of course dont subject it to extreme heat or cold omnidirectional soundup to hrs battery life more than enough for a full day of partying assuming you get hrs of sleep to round out a hr day it will take up to hrs to recharge a fully discharged battery ip rating this means this speaker goes beyond simply being cowardly splash proof but boldly insists on being dunked under water in approximately feet of water for up to minutes i was too afraid to put this to the test since i did not want to ruin a speaker ill take ue at their wordstrong bluetooth connection i didnt experience any bluetooth stuttering or disconnections in fact ue boasts that the bluetooth range is up to feet wifi music streaming from iheartradio amazon prime music and tunein radio through amazon alexa pandora and deezer are purportedly to be included in the future integrated amazon alexa voice assistant this may or may not be important to you depending on whether or not you are already subscribed to one of the two dominant voice assistant ecosystems amazon alexa google assistant presently available in the market features that are missing equally important to the features aka the selling points are the features that are missing in the ue megablast which are offered by some of the competitors in the portable bluetooth speaker marketno nfc connection no mm audio jack i am disappointed but not surprised would have been great if ue included a mm jack since wired audio quality is still better than bluetooth transmission audio quality you cannot connect two or more ue megablasts together or to other speakers in the ue lineup via bluetooth in a party mode to have multiple speakers playing the same music simultaneously not sure why ue took this feature off the table just imagine how loud your party could get if you could connect them together audio quality i was impressed by the audio output of the speakers the omnidirectional aka degree sound meant that there are no fading audio dead spots as i moved about my room the ue megablast can get really loud to the point that your neighbors will be knocking on your door to turn it down the midrange representing vocals and speech is very crisp and clear the highs are equally well represented bass kicks in strong without overpowering the high and midrange frequencies this means that when youre listening to music with strong bass you can still clearly hear the vocals and if you choose to watch a movie using the ue megablast you can clearly hear the bass response from action sequences but wouldnt have to adjust equalizers to hear dialogue amazon alexa voice assistant im not going to go too much into this you are initially asked to connect to amazon alexa when you first set up the speaker through the ultimate ears app available through the google play store or apple app store the microphone does a fine job of picking up audio across my room and im able to ask alexa questions and give it commands alexa will only work if the speaker is connected through the wifi network it will not work on a bluetooth only connectionif you find yourself desiring some privacy you have two options to turn off the microphone from listening to your conversation first method is to open the ultimate ears app tap on the microphone icon and tap off to disable the microphones a tone will be emitted and a small red light will illuminate at the top of the speaker to indicate that the microphones have been turned off the second method is to use the speaker controls on the speaker press the volume down and the bluetooth button simultaneously you will hear a tone and see the red light at the top of the speaker this indicates that the microphone has been turned off to turn them back on press the same buttons again finally one thing to take note ue did a poor job with the location for the micro usb charging port the port is located at the bottom base of the speaker that means when you are charging it you will have to place the speaker on its side horizontally which means it has a strong chance of rolling off your table or you can place the speaker upside down with the power button on the bottom the only other alternative is to purchase the charging dock which will allow you to charge the speaker in the upright position conclusion do i recommend the ue megablast given its very good audio quality and sleek rugged build quality i totally believe it is a sound choice pun intended and should be on your short list however given that some of the features are noticeably missing which were found in the previous ue lineup eg megaboom at a lower price point you will need to really ask yourself if the addition of the alexa assistant is worth the tradeoff,"{'neg': 0.05, 'neu': 0.859, 'pos': 0.091, 'compound': 0.9928}",positive

4,i was excited to open the sony srs xb as my previous bluetooth speaker was relatively cheap and left a lot to be desired soundwiseso opening up the box which in itself is nice and tactile you are greeted straight away by the speaker no messing around pulled it out and powered it up the indicator in the songpal app ill get to that later showed charge so that was great meant i could use it right out of the box syncd it to my phone without instructions by pressing the big bluetooth button and then looking for it on my phone just like you would with any other bluetooth device paired up really quickly chose my first song to play through it and away i went bam the little speaker had a nice punch straight out of the gate i was very impressed almost taken aback as i checked it out turned the volume up and it sounded great then as anyone would you have to press the extra bass button when you do dual passive radiators work together with stereo fullrange speakers to enhance the lowend tones giving bass a nice boost despite the speakers compact size basically it sounds fantastic however i found that the speaker sounds fantastic at a lower volume and when you are close to it as i stepped away from the speaker and turned up the volume the bass intensity dropped and more higher end sounds took precedence i live in a moderately sized home with ft ceilings in the living room and the speaker was able to fill the room with sound but didnt sound quite as bassbacked as it did when the volume was lower and i was closer to it however i am still very impressed with what this speaker can do considering its size on to the songpal app i opened it up and got the speaker hooked up to it and from there you can change many settings on the speaker it has an illuminated led ring around it and two strobe lights you can turn them on and off and you can control certain colors of the ring with predetermined color pattens within the app but you cannot directly choose the color with a color wheel you can also check battery status power settings adjust the extra bass and more the unit claims a hour battery life when not using the lights on it and so far its living up to its claims you can connect via bluetooth as mentioned or also via usbyou can also link speakers so if you have more than one of them you can link them for stereo sounds and if you want more you can link up to of them together for a full on party atmosphere the speaker is also waterresistant not completely waterproof so dont drop it in the pool and expect it to work but it is splash proof and spill proof so you can take it and use it at the beach as long as you make sure that the internal components cover is securely fastened as sony mentions many times in the instruction manualyou can connect up to three devices to it as well although i havent tried this feature as i would only use it with my phone i would love to see a power indicator on my phone as to how much power is left in the speaker i use a pair of sony bluetooth headphones mdrxbbt every day and they provide a little icon showing how much charge is left in them on my phone that would be useful with the speaker as i may not always use the songpal app when using the speaker as for the songpal app i had an issue with the speaker connecting twice to it and then not registering either of them i had to erase the speakers and reconnect them not a deal breaker but it made the songpal app feel a little clunky it would be nice to have a color wheel to choose individual colors for the led ring around the speaker but again not a deal breaker but a nice to have feature overall i am very impressed with the sony srs xb bluetooth speaker and i would recommend it to my friends without hesitation,"{'neg': 0.011, 'neu': 0.87, 'pos': 0.119, 'compound': 0.9971}",positive

4,this is the third bluetooth speaker we have in the house which enables me to make a direct comparison to two competitors from different manufacturers however the other two have price points higher than this sony xb with a msrp one is higher and the other is higherthe sony comes in multiple colors and the outside of the case has a rubberized finish with metal grilles front and rear the back one is for a passive radiator the unit has a nice substantial feel to it and that combined with the feel of the controls gives the sensation of a quality made piece the front grille is surrounded by a light bar that has a number of different preprogrammed colors and patterns along with a couple of white strobes none of which appear to keep time or rhythm to the music being played the light show variations cannot be accessed directly from the speakers builtin controls you have to make changes from the songpal app which is free but you can toggle the current light selection on or off using a button on the speaker the jacks for power audio in and usb connection to charge your phone from the speaker are on the back of the speaker under a cover that has a water resistant gasket as the speaker is ipx rated for water resistance note that if the cover is open for a connection its water resistance is compromisedthe extra bass function provides a nice bass boost that once you become accustomed to it leaves the speaker sounding kind of tinny or thin when it is turned off i did find the speaker to be lacking in treble both when playing files from itunes via my iphone and when connected with a cable to an ipod classic playing apple lossless files the songpal app has a rudimentary threeband graphic equalizer enabling you to adjust bass midrange and treble from flat to or with three sliders the bass and mid had a noticeable effect on the content i listened to but the treble control had virtually no effect that i could telltwo features i was not able to try out were the wireless party chain since i have only one sony speaker and the ldac audio technology which is a higher quality bluetooth connection which appears to be a proprietary sony technology available on their zx highresolution audio walkman and xperia smartphonesi realize i am probably not in the target audience for this particular product due to my age but i am a little confused by the combination of the multicolored line light and flashing strobe that would have probably appealed to the yearold me along with the ldac technology that comes in a hires music player that the yearold me could afford but has difficulty rationalizing i would expect someone with a highresolution audiophilequality music player to be shopping wireless speakers at a much higher price point than thisthe xb has a builtin microphone which enables you to have phone conversations using the device as a speakermic sound quality was far superior to the iphones speaker phone function for both ends of the conversation to be expected given the size difference of the speakers between the two devices this feature helps the xb earn a place on your work deski think the xb represents a good value for its price point given the additional technology and features it possesses when compared to the two other bluetooth speakers i am familiar with however the lack of treble response is a little disappointing at least to me sound quality can be a rather subjective matter and to be fair i was not able to judge its sound with it being driven by a ldac capable device there are many other players at this price level so i suggest comparing at a retailer where you can listen to multiple speaker choices before making a decision,"{'neg': 0.023, 'neu': 0.904, 'pos': 0.073, 'compound': 0.9804}",positive

4,despite its best efforts to scare me off i actually do like this speaker a lot unboxing the speaker two things immediately struck me first the speaker is smaller than id thought it would be based on the box lots of packing materials to keep it safe second the speaker feels surprisingly heavy given its size it only weighs a little more than pounds according to my kitchen scale but it feels a lot heavier than that when youre holding it in your hand i got the speaker in blue one of my favorite colors the blue is a duskier shade than i was expecting but its still pleasing to the eye that being said i do regret not having picked this up in black as it would have coordinated with my furniture better the texture is lightly rubberized and purports to be water resistant the front of the speaker bears an led light ring that can be customized to hit a range of different colors all of the speakers ports are hidden behind a door on the back righthand side it came with a great big notice taped to it advising you to make sure that the door is shut when the unit is in use i can only presume that this is to ensure the units water resistance as it seems to operate perfectly fine with the door wide open a surprising addition to the ports is a traditional usb type a port it should be noted that this port is for power output only and does not support power input or data transfer the documentation says that the port is included to charge ones phone or tablet using the speaker this is a nice addition but it feels a little random to me turning it on proved to be the first stumbling block for this review following the instructions i charged the device for four hours prior to attempting to use it with the speaker still plugged into the wall i pressed the power button and nothing happened i tried pressing it several times and got no response whatsoever i worried that i might have received a defective unit but unplugging the device from the wall and pressing the power button finally yielded results with the device promptly turning on oddly this was the only time that i encountered this issue i have since left it plugged in and pressed the power button and it turns on right away charging proved to be another oddity with this device using it for about two hours i was down to battery according to the phone app that goes with this speaker with the speaker still on i plugged it in to see about charging it while using it an hour later the app still reported a battery status of im not sure whether this is a characteristic of the device itself or a glitch with the phone app pairing the device was simple enough on an android phone i did have to turn my bluetooth on and off to get it to show up but i suspect that was the result of a bug on my phone and not with this speaker the app that works with this speaker is a little too generic and lacks polish this is where things start to go downhill first the big selling point for this speaker is its ability to wirelessly pair up and synchronize with other speakers from this series to create a stereo or surround sound effect i couldnt test this as i only had a single speaker to work with sony really ought to consider selling these in multipacks if theyre going to make such a big deal of this capability i knew from my own research prior to getting this speaker that this capability only works with other speakers from this series you cant use other bluetooth speakers from other manufacturers or even other models of sony speakers to do this that being said the language in the app is very vague and makes it sound like you can grab any old bluetooth speaker to create a wireless speaker network curious to see if this was actually the case i grabbed a pair of bluetooth speakers from other manufacturers and attempted to pair them sadly as expected neither one of them would pair second the apps control of the customizable led light ring isnt quite what i was led to believe given the packaging and documentation my hope was to use this speaker with my home theater system and have it paired with my home theater pc rather than a phone or tablet given the speakers ability to link up with other speakers id had thoughts about maybe using this to eventually implement a wireless surround sound andor whole home speaker system my pc setup has a nice blue led lighting effect and i thought it would be cool to get the led ring on the speaker to match the blue that the rest of my setup has thats when i discovered the second shortcoming of the app you cant select a single color for the led ring to glow the app only gives you a list of preset color schemes that you can choose to have it cycle through you cant select just a single color and tell the speaker to hold it continuously special psa on the lighting if youre epileptic dont attempt to use this speaker until you adjust the color settings by default this speaker came in rave mode which has white flashing strobes along the left and right edges there was no mention of this strobe effect in any of the materials i read prior to getting this speaker and its a little disturbing that this was enabled by default third the voice control button within the app doesnt appear to actually do anything pressing it prompts you to say a keyword i tried saying sony speaker hey you and play queens bohemian rhapsody but i had no luck getting the app or speaker to react pressing the help button within the app didnt lead me to anything offering any support for this saying google did pull up a screen with icons for google music and youtube but i couldnt get the app to do anything beyond that point using voice controls unfortunately the shortcomings arent limited to just the app the speaker also has a button on the top for bass boost upon first using the speaker i was very impressed by the sound it was clear and loud with a lot of punch to it curious to see what it would sound like with even more bass i pressed the bass button on the top and the sound immediately went flat and tinny apparently the bass button was already enabled by default given the way that this is set up the bass button is less of a boost button and more of a make my music sound anemic and bad button the perception would have been much improved had they not opted to have this enabled by default using the speaker on a phone call yielded mixed results the audio came over both loud and crystal clear on my end that being said the person on the other line said that my voice was distant and full of distortion suffice it to say that speakers microphone isnt very good a couple of warnings if youre going to try and use this as a speaker on a pc first you wont be able to control the speakers settings from the pc youre going to have to use the phone app to control things like power management and the led lighting secondly youre going to want to go into the power management options within the app to turn off the autooff power saving feature this feature is enabled by default the speaker doesnt automatically wake after powering down if you dont turn off the autooff then you will be forced to press the power button on the speaker to turn it back on after it powers down the amazing thing is that despite the shortcomings that ive listed i still really like this speaker the led lighting is fun the sound is terrific with lots of volume and bass and the aesthetic is nice and clean is the speaker perfect no is the speaker really good yes despite the shortcomings im still seriously considering buying another one to use in my home theater setup i would recommend

4,i received this product as part of the best buy tech insider program for my honest review the sony xb bluetooth speaker is a good bluetooth accessory but not perfect to my ears the sound seems a little muffled the highs and mid range sounds dont seem as sharp and crisp as i had hoped im not saying that the sound is bad because it isnt but maybe i expected a little more sound volume is good for indoor use or outdoors if you are going to be near the speaker it is not a speaker you could use to provide music for a large group or a pool party or something similar if you are hanging out by the pool or at the beach this speaker has plenty of volume howerver one thing i would change on the speaker is the charging system the speaker has a proprietary charger i would have much rather they sent a usb charger of some type to charge of of a computer or where you could use an existing cell phone charger when you need to add a little power the speaker will last a long time on a single charge however so you shouldnt be charging all that often unless you are a power user the speaker is good for what i will use it for sitting around a campsite or watching my little girls dance to music off my phone in the backyard its a good speaker with some potential,"{'neg': 0.035, 'neu': 0.865, 'pos': 0.1, 'compound': 0.9377}",positive
4,this is a great little speaker for the price it is very loud and does have good bass the sound can be a little higher because the bass is a bit overpowering but there is an equalizer that can change how the sound comes out i did wish the battery was more accurate it says hours but they dont tell you that its with the lights off bass boost off and im not sure at what volume it has to be to get that kind of battery life but i would say realistically at about half volume with the lights and bass boost turned off you can get to maybe hours,"{'neg': 0.021, 'neu': 0.85, 'pos': 0.129, 'compound': 0.9137}",positive

4,this is the third bluetooth speaker we have in the house which enables me to make a direct comparison to two competitors from different manufacturers however the other two have price points higher than this sony xb with a msrp one is higher and the other is higherthe sony comes in multiple colors and the outside of the case has a rubberized finish with metal grilles front and rear the back one is for a passive radiator the unit has a nice substantial feel to it and that combined with the feel of the controls gives the sensation of a quality made piece the front grille is surrounded by a light bar that has a number of different preprogrammed colors and patterns along with a couple of white strobes none of which appear to keep time or rhythm to the music being played the light show variations cannot be accessed directly from the speakers builtin controls you have to make changes from the songpal app which is free but you can toggle the current light selection on or off using a button on the speaker the jacks for power audio in and usb connection to charge your phone from the speaker are on the back of the speaker under a cover that has a water resistant gasket as the speaker is ipx rated for water resistance note that if the cover is open for a connection its water resistance is compromisedthe extra bass function provides a nice bass boost that once you become accustomed to it leaves the speaker sounding kind of tinny or thin when it is turned off i did find the speaker to be lacking in treble both when playing files from itunes via my iphone and when connected with a cable to an ipod classic playing apple lossless files the songpal app has a rudimentary threeband graphic equalizer enabling you to adjust bass midrange and treble from flat to or with three sliders the bass and mid had a noticeable effect on the content i listened to but the treble control had virtually no effect that i could telltwo features i was not able to try out were the wireless party chain since i have only one sony speaker and the ldac audio technology which is a higher quality bluetooth connection which appears to be a proprietary sony technology available on their zx highresolution audio walkman and xperia smartphonesi realize i am probably not in the target audience for this particular product due to my age but i am a little confused by the combination of the multicolored line light and flashing strobe that would have probably appealed to the yearold me along with the ldac technology that comes in a hires music player that the yearold me could afford but has difficulty rationalizing i would expect someone with a highresolution audiophilequality music player to be shopping wireless speakers at a much higher price point than thisthe xb has a builtin microphone which enables you to have phone conversations using the device as a speakermic sound quality was far superior to the iphones speaker phone function for both ends of the conversation to be expected given the size difference of the speakers between the two devices this feature helps the xb earn a place on your work deski think the xb represents a good value for its price point given the additional technology and features it possesses when compared to the two other bluetooth speakers i am familiar with however the lack of treble response is a little disappointing at least to me sound quality can be a rather subjective matter and to be fair i was not able to judge its sound with it being driven by a ldac capable device there are many other players at this price level so i suggest comparing at a retailer where you can listen to multiple speaker choices before making a decision,"{'neg': 0.023, 'neu': 0.904, 'pos': 0.073, 'compound': 0.9804}",positive

4,i was excited to open the sony srs xb as my previous bluetooth speaker was relatively cheap and left a lot to be desired soundwiseso opening up the box which in itself is nice and tactile you are greeted straight away by the speaker no messing around pulled it out and powered it up the indicator in the songpal app ill get to that later showed charge so that was great meant i could use it right out of the box syncd it to my phone without instructions by pressing the big bluetooth button and then looking for it on my phone just like you would with any other bluetooth device paired up really quickly chose my first song to play through it and away i went bam the little speaker had a nice punch straight out of the gate i was very impressed almost taken aback as i checked it out turned the volume up and it sounded great then as anyone would you have to press the extra bass button when you do dual passive radiators work together with stereo fullrange speakers to enhance the lowend tones giving bass a nice boost despite the speakers compact size basically it sounds fantastic however i found that the speaker sounds fantastic at a lower volume and when you are close to it as i stepped away from the speaker and turned up the volume the bass intensity dropped and more higher end sounds took precedence i live in a moderately sized home with ft ceilings in the living room and the speaker was able to fill the room with sound but didnt sound quite as bassbacked as it did when the volume was lower and i was closer to it however i am still very impressed with what this speaker can do considering its size on to the songpal app i opened it up and got the speaker hooked up to it and from there you can change many settings on the speaker it has an illuminated led ring around it and two strobe lights you can turn them on and off and you can control certain colors of the ring with predetermined color pattens within the app but you cannot directly choose the color with a color wheel you can also check battery status power settings adjust the extra bass and more the unit claims a hour battery life when not using the lights on it and so far its living up to its claims you can connect via bluetooth as mentioned or also via usbyou can also link speakers so if you have more than one of them you can link them for stereo sounds and if you want more you can link up to of them together for a full on party atmosphere the speaker is also waterresistant not completely waterproof so dont drop it in the pool and expect it to work but it is splash proof and spill proof so you can take it and use it at the beach as long as you make sure that the internal components cover is securely fastened as sony mentions many times in the instruction manualyou can connect up to three devices to it as well although i havent tried this feature as i would only use it with my phone i would love to see a power indicator on my phone as to how much power is left in the speaker i use a pair of sony bluetooth headphones mdrxbbt every day and they provide a little icon showing how much charge is left in them on my phone that would be useful with the speaker as i may not always use the songpal app when using the speaker as for the songpal app i had an issue with the speaker connecting twice to it and then not registering either of them i had to erase the speakers and reconnect them not a deal breaker but it made the songpal app feel a little clunky it would be nice to have a color wheel to choose individual colors for the led ring around the speaker but again not a deal breaker but a nice to have feature overall i am very impressed with the sony srs xb bluetooth speaker and i would recommend it to my friends without hesitation,"{'neg': 0.011, 'neu': 0.87, 'pos': 0.119, 'compound': 0.9971}",positive

4,as a dog owner i have often wondered about what happens during times i cant see my dog what does the dog do during the day if i am not there how does the dog react to various stimuli when exactly does the dog react to the car when i sleep what is the dog doingwell i have used other cameras for this purpose but frankly that is always a bit sketchy because i have no control over the camera and cant use it in the dark needless to say i was really excited when i saw this camera offered whats in the box you receive the smaller camera it is really small about the size of your palm plus some instructions and the power pack aesthetic this is a functional item however besides being pretty small in almost aspect about the size of your palm it has a sturdy stand to sit on that you can swivel around with a microphone on the back that can also be moved quite easily usethe first step after removing the camera is to get it online with your existing wifi network this was a task i did not look forward to because these types of items typically will take a bit of doing to get going here you are instructed to download the app for the device you have handy for myself i used a ipad and then start the wifi acquisition process the camera found my wifi network easily but it took a few tries for it to register completiononce the setup was complete then the camera worked very well default settings immediately told me about happening around the camera this includes both motion and sound as the app is in place notifications are sent to your device as often as there is activityactual use i tried this in many different environments and times of course there is a camera on this device and the quality is pretty good although not complete hd second and for me a most welcome part is the infrared capability yes actual infrared capability and after testing this over many nights it works very well it even picked up both the occasional moth and mosquito flying around at night it is pretty sensitivethe camera has the ability of twoway communication though the microphone you simply hit an icon in the app to talk and you can also play tunes as well by hitting another icon in addition you can take a photo as well if you want access not yet i have used the microphone function and it works pretty well the camera has provided some real enjoyment and revelation different sleeping places more or less movement that you would think and some real indications that dogs are pretty pathetic animals without social interaction they must be in a pack for true securitythe camera allows you to also watch in real time with the microphone you can communicate with your pet as would be expected there is a slight delay seconds perhapsso you have to keep that in mind in addition there is a temperature monitor how cool is that as wellserver the app and computer login under the strange and seemingly unrelated name hubble provides plenty of access more on this in bit give you a timeline to look up various short typically just about seconds films of your chosen activity dog kid etc or more if these is a continued stream of activity plus you can also see when there is just a sound though it does not apparently record the sound the timeline is on a server which means be careful what is recorded with this thingnotifications when this is powered on the camera dutifully will tell you what is going on at home or elsewhere around the camera you will receive a constant stream of alerts sometimes this is fine but other times this will drive you nuts and apparently there is no way at this time to maneuver the alerts to tamp them down so if you are in a business meeting prepare to be driven crazy with the knowledge you dog has moved around i expect this will be updated with a app update so this will probably be added laterapp the app at this time is pretty basic you can look at the camera that is powered on and see the timeline of activity you can simply scroll down and view the desired activity with your app there is no apparent way to email the clips to yourself that i have foundissue the app goes to a cloud server if the camera records something it shouldnt then you can simply delete the clip by hitting the screen and a delete icon will appear the camera itself is pretty inconspicuous so it would be easy to have this record things you may regret laterthe main point is that you must be really careful with the camera and the server second is it would be really terrific to be able to email the clips to yourself so you can edit them and do something with them other than just view the server in addition one concern i have is that it looks like there will be a charged service for at least some features as there is a plan tab currently available is just free howeversettings again at this time the major issue with the app is it has very limited control although there is a tab that has settings you cant do anything with it and this means you cant control the notifications for example i hope this is addressed in a future software updateoverall i enjoyed fooling around with this camera the camera and the if camera are quite sensitive the microphone when coupled with the video clips is quite sensitive for a dog owner or cat owner or whatever the camera provides an easy realtime access through which you can see what is happening in your home or wherever that camera is placed with wifi of course i have some concerns about server access i think this needs to be addressed with some further security measures as this is a cloud based service but overall the experience is a lot of funi give this a strong to stars based on the above for the technology given frankly the cost isnt so expensive but it is still something you have to think about for purchase yet if you have the inclination this is a pretty well integrated product,"{'neg': 0.032, 'neu': 0.848, 'pos': 0.12, 'compound': 0.9987}",positive
4,this wifi camera can be used for monitoring pets or children it could even be used for home security but its not safe to put outside because its not weatherproof it was easy to initially set up i had to connect to it with my ipad through wifi and then download the motorola hubble monitor app and it will find and register your camera once its registered you can log in to the app at any time from any place and view live streaming with audio the video quality is fair but nothing impressive the audio signal sounds good there is usually about a second delay in the audio and second delay in the video feed i have had no problems logging on and viewing the video feed while i was away from home you have the ability to view the video and talk to your pet and you can hear them as well there is a two way microphone so you can actually interact with them even if you are miles away during a vacation if you love your pets like i do then you will probably really like this system the hubble monitor app allows you to adjust both sound and motion sensing levels and it will automatically start recording when it either hears a noise or picks up movement this option will come in handy if you are wanting to check in on your pet while on vacation you can view the live video but if they arent currently visible on the camera then you can look at a time earlier in the day when the camera picked them up the app gives you a timeline with information that is useful like periods of time that were all quiet or times when it picked up noise it will also tell you when it picks up movement when it picks up either sound or movement then it will start recording this camera also has ir night vision and it automatically turns the night vision on when it gets dark the night vision works well and allows you to get a pretty good video even when its pitch black out the range is pretty good toofor the time being this recording option is free but it looks like this will be a pay service at some point according to the hubble connected website it looks like the manual recording and streaming options will remain free but automatic recording is going to be a paid plan that you will have to subscribe to there will be different paid plans depending on how long you want to be able to store video on the cloud one option will retain all recorded videos up to hours the next plan will retain videos for one week and the last plan will retain videos for a month this is the one thing that i dont like about this system this camera has a high enough price tag that you shouldnt have to purchase a subscription in my opinion i do like the system that they set up but again i wouldnt want to pay a monthly subscription feethis camera even takes a temperature reading and displays in on your screen you can even set it to alert you if the temperature goes below or above a certain level this is another nice option for me because i can control my thermostat in my house remotely through my nexia home intelligence system if i need toi like this camera quite a bit but i wish it was waterproof and i hope they dont start requiring subscription especially considering that there is no warning on the amazon product page that tells potential customers that they may need to purchase a subscription in the future to get all of the benefits,"{'neg': 0.04, 'neu': 0.793, 'pos': 0.168, 'compound': 0.9982}",positive

4,i really liked these and wanted to keep them because they make one heck of a first impression but i ultimately had to return them removing the lid of the box greets you with the unmistakable smell of brand new genuine leather from the thick headband to the ear cups this baby is soft premium leather all the way the metal frame that connects them is strong and gives confidence that theyre not going to accidentally bend or break from anything but an almost intentional force against them heres my first comparison to its peers most every other set even over is almost completely plastic this is solid metal and leather through and through and its heavier than its competitors for it thats already a striking difference and makes a good argument for a higher price tag its obviously a higher quality product with better materials i also like that the ear cups are removable and magnetically attached should there be an unrepairable break or tear just buy a new set and pop them on underneath the left cup is where the cord attaches this is also a great idea as the port tends to get damaged when the cord is pulled or water seeps in you can tell there was a lot of thought put towards the design the picture doesnt do these justice they impress from top to bottom one thing they dont look like is something you want to sweat all over or wear on rainy days so have something else for gyms sweltering heat and storm season outdoors theyre also softer than they look the ear pads are filled with memory foam so theyre very soft to the touch and the headband is also nicely padded i also like the added thickness on top they did feel good at first when i put them on but i felt some discomfort during my hours of wearing them the clamping pressure started to make my upper jaw under my ear ache they seal very well and isolate from most of the outside noise theyre easily the best noise isolating headphones ive ever put on they fold in on both sides to fit easier in a small bag or case making them more portable the ear cups dont swivel thoughill be honest here about the sound i have to say i came away disappointed they dont sound bad by any means but theyre warmer in the mid range that i like which sacrifices some of the treble that im used to i cycled through a variety of different types of music and when comparing them directly against my audio technica mxs they didnt blow them away which is what i was kind of expecting them to do given their price point and reputation i then realized that it wasnt a realistic expectation because my mxs are actually very good headphones and nothing is going to make them sound like garbage i thought the ps would outperform them so well that id just ditch them completely that didnt happen in fact im now convinced that its probably not wise to expect any competent set of headphones to be rendered obsolete by a more expensive set like these if you have a good set already thats at least over to and up by well established companies like sennheiser vmoda beyerdynamic bose audio technica sony etc intentionally omitting the over priced and overrated beats the ps wont completely redefine good sound for you at least they didnt for me once i got over that i focused in on what they are and what they do well as much as what they do differently than what i already have my mxs are just a notch above neutral in bass and treble with no mids which is something i like about them these are a different flavor altogether the mids and lows are much more pronounced pushing vocals to the forefront beck was practically singing right in front of my face when i played some of his music stringed instruments in classical and jazz genres also received a big boost from the extra attention cellos harps and stand up basses were much fuller than my other set ever told me bass kicked electronic music daft punk deadmau up a few notches over my ats as well but never got overbearing or obnoxious i really like the deeper bass and thicker overall sound on bass heavy music but im not a bass head so i dont want bass drowning out the instruments and vocals either it sounds like its getting close to the threshold of going over the edge but never getting there i like a lot of rock music too which is something my ats can do very well most of the bands actually sounded better on them than on the ps which is probably due to the treble coming down a couple of notches i prefer a v shaped sound favoring the treble and bass in fact i usually have the treble dialed all the way up on my eqs so i missed that high sizzle from cymbals and snap from the snare drums i also couldnt distinguish all the instruments as well on harder tunes with heavier distortion on the guitars on a particularly heavy song the high hat cymbal was almost completely drowned out and it took my mxs to remember how much i should be hearing it the extra emphasis on the mids and bass made the sound fuller but muddied the separation the ps made most everything sound better and outperformed my mxs just not it the rock category which is a big one for me they came up short according to my tastes headphones originally priced at shouldnt have such a glaring weakness they should do everything really well but dont that was the main reason why i had to let them gooutside of music the ps also worked well with tv shows and movies vocals came through clearly and soundtracks and effects delivered a more home theater like experience the extra oomph really delivered on action scenes and dialog was more distinguishable my mxs held their own while doing a direct comparison thoughthere are cords provided and the one attached for apple devices included controls that worked flawlessly with my ipad the cord even feels better in comparison to others ive felt a drawback is the included case while its nice to receive one and it is of the same fine leather as found on the headphones im not a fan of soft cases especially not for expensive electronics itll do fine for around the house or light travel use but if youre going to put these in a suitcase or travel far and frequently id have my reservations these are well worth a little extra money to protect them from falls drops getting sat on or being crushed by other bags the included soft case also looks more like one of my wifes makeup bags which is a bit of a turn off thats a very minor gripe thoughin conclusion these are premium luxury headphones the look like it feel like it smell like it and but come short of sounding like it which is what matters most to me if youve already invested in a decent set of headphones they wont completely redefine portable listening for you but theyll provide you with a quality product thats physically head and shoulders above everything else ive seen on the store shelvesi still do recommend these for people who want a premium build and appreciate warmer sounds for heavy vocals stringed instruments and almost everything else theyre still very good hard rock is their achilles heel though im just like hearing that separation amongst the distortion i now have a greater appreciation for my mxs though going head to head against a high end headphone like the p and coming out on top is pretty remarkable and even though it was a tough decision that was the main reason why i couldnt keep them i just couldnt justify paying for a set of headphones that didnt completely outperform my mxs are actually lacking the treble that i like and hurt from the extra clamping force but they sure are nice looking,"{'neg': 0.046, 'neu': 0.775, 'pos': 0.179, 'compound':

4,bluf great remote and would buy againthis is a replacement for a harmony discontinued that was beginning to fail and this was a great upgradefor background i have been using and programming various remotes for years going back to older philips pronto remotes this is a very intuitive and powerful platform in a reasonably priced package coming from another harmony remote the initial setup was very simple with a few tweaks for preference and new capability i say that acknowledging i am something of a geek and understand the basics of how remotes work and their limitations even for the technologically challenged logitech has done a good job of making the programming interface intuitive and easy to use but still powerful enough for advanced users to customize if anything it errors on the side of simplicity vice functionalitysome of the biggest concerns i had was the fastforwardskip button since the two functions have been combined into a single button with this remote i was quite leery of this as a directv customer but happy to report that with a bit of tweaking and use of the gestures this is completely a nonissue only shortfall i can complain about is the lack of immediate access to the number pad you can swipe leftright to it but i would prefer to map a soft key to bring it up niggling issue that may be possible but i havent found an easy way to do it just yetthe biggest complaint and the area where logitech misses the mark is as others have pointed out with the basic ergonomics the hard buttons are great the touch screen is great and the overall size of the remote is great they just need to reorganize put the touchscreen at the very top and move the transport controls ff pause record play etc under the screen it would even benefit from being slightly longer to allow the main controls to sit just above center where your thumb naturally sits and fit better in the hand i complain about this pointing out this is a great unit that could benefit from a refresh same functionality in a slightly different packageto wrap this up i am very pleased with this remote overall it is not perfect and could use a change to the basic layout but it is a solid unit that is very flexible and a pleasure to use if you are considering this a a first universal remote or an upgrade to an existing one it is well worth it,"{'neg': 0.058, 'neu': 0.725, 'pos': 0.217, 'compound': 0.9976}",positive

4,compared to all of the other logitech products i have owned including numerous mice keyboards and three harmony ones the ultimate one performs surprisingly poorly with regard to its programming softwaremaybe once i get it working it will work ok but that will never excuse the following would not work on a win bit home premium computer failed with multiple download errors unexpected or unknown error try again downloading the harmony app and attempting to install without downloading the harmony app would not work on a win bit ultimate computer failed with the same multiple download errors downloading the harmony app and attempting to install without downloading the harmony app finally installed on a win computer retrieved my info from previous harmony one or did i cant confirm this none of the supposedly retrieved settings are ones i have used in several years yet failed to retrieve settings for watching tv or bluray eg my directv one or directv two receivers eg watch tv or bluray activities sony bluray which of course are the primary activities for which i purchased remotefor after hours with basically no progress to me that is worse than useless i have wasted precious family time without any satisfaction for which i purchased remote i seek products that work as advertised without unsolvable complications eg unexpected error unknown error no tech support available no google threads regarding error messages implicit solution buytry another computer if i were a teenager this conundrum might be interesting but as it is i do not have lots of spare time to tinker with problems caused by engineers who release products that are not ready for prime time oh and by the way logitech keeps more or less bankers hours ie monday through friday to so forget about tech support unless you dont have a jobby way of comparison it used to take me minutes to program the harmony one with the ultimate one and hours into the project all i can control is the volume on the av amplifierwish i had never had reason to make an acquaintance with ultimate one unless you have lots of time to kill i recommend that you avoid it and wait for next iteration of harmony remote or seek alternative companys remote if availableas piece of hardware the ultimate one may have promise if i get out of the woods with the software i will post the resultsaddendum ok now that the remote is programmed i love this remote overall i prefer logitech products eg razer mouse k illuminated wireless keyboard squeezebox touch harmony one no design is perfect given that compromises are always necessary but i tend to prefer their solutions so i have high expectations as for the harmony ultimate i like the form factor including the decreased size from the one perhaps the dvr buttons should be on the bottom but it does not bother me as it does others and the flexibility and power of the programming is a definite leap forward i havent yet tried the onscreen leap forwardjump back buttons but if i dont like them i can always program two of the colored buttons at the bottom to perform those functions for me it was not that hard to program i just needed to take a break after all the initial frustration when the software would not installif it were not for the install glitches i would give the ultimate one a out of stars as my experience got off to such a rocky start and others may not own computers with a variety of operating systems in order to troubleshoot myharmony software install issues and lack of eveningweekend technical support stars is is as high as i can goi believe seamless compatibility with win should be a given although i suppose you could try and blame windows but for a company as widespread as logitech it seems they should be able to do a lot better fwiw the win computer is not my favorite but i purchased it a year after win was released in order to attempt to keep up with the times and this is the second occasion it has come in handy ie when my daughter had to do violin tests for public middle school orchestra the smart music app failed with an incomprehensible error same problem with only daytime mf tech support and no searchable threads to explore any solutions so we installed smartmusic on the new all in one portable win dell and never looked back problem solved still mostly love this remote my vote remains starsin case it hasnt already been answered via other threads the directv jump forwardback button functions approx sec forward seconds back if memory serves do still exist on this remote but they are indeed hidden by an androidstyle tap versus presshold gesture ie tapping the ff or rw button brings up the fast forwardrewind functions eg taps equals times speed for ffrw whereas presshold brings up the jump forwardback functions with a vibrate signal to indicate success in accessing the presshold feature so you know when to let go found these functions by accident one day when i pressed and held the buttons a bit too long one second i supposemy only real gripe with this remote now is that occasionally i press the power off button when i am trying to press the rewind button it would be nice if the power button was a bit more physically isolated from the rw button if you dont watch tv every day sometimes your tactile grasp of where the buttons are on the remote is less secure and you really dont need to

you learn the layout and compares well to that of the harmony one really who needs physical number buttons when youre watching dvr and easy to operate even if you are working out on an elliptical

4,after having a room full of remotes i was excited to set up and try the harmony remote the instructions were simple to follow the screen is clear and easy to read it does take a bit of time to get used to in relation to turning the systems on and off and where to go within the screen i really like the fact you can integrate multiple systems especially in an era where we have so many systems in one area games cable dvd tv etc the one downfall for me is that its another cable with another charger i already have a computer bluetooth and phone charging and now i have to keep the charging station out for the remote this may not be a big tradeoff for some but i found it a bit annoying,"{'neg': 0.026, 'neu': 0.905, 'pos': 0.068, 'compound': 0.3912}",neutral
4,if you are familiar with the harmony webbased setup then setup is a breeze i also have a harmony touch so the setup was painless for me i recall the touch took about min the first time and subsequent trips to the setup for new devices or channel favorites was a snapthe screen interface difference with this unit to me is cleaner now it is less cluttered than my touchsince i had the touch setup when i logged in to my harmony it asked me if i wanted to transfer the settings to the ultimate onewell yes i do thank you very much boom just like that all my devices were set up however we just got an appletv and as one might guess it was a breeze to set that up toofor those that dont know you enter your devices on the website then create activites based on them for example you have a tuner a tv a cable box a game console a bluray player and an appletv for watch tv you use the tv the tuner and the cable box you let the harmony know the hdmi or other input on the tv that the tuner gets switched to cablesat then the activity becomes turn on the tv and make sure it is switched to the proper input turn on the tuner and switch it to the proper output and turn on the cable box when you hit the off button all get turned off say while watching tv you want to watch a movie then the cable box gets turned off the bluray player gets turned on and the tuner switches its output mode to blu raydvd same for gaming radio etcafter the unit is programmed your remote situation goes to a single remote and touchscreen goodnessmy woman loves them one remote so no clutter she wants to watch tv she touches watch tv then goes to our favorites to tap an icon of the channels logo it is quick an painless to bring up the soft number pad for change the channel manuallymost major functions of all devices are on the remote i still need to get the device remotes out for things like firmware updates or specialized functions or to run specific apps like netflix but for the day to dayone remote does it all and that is fantastic,"{'neg': 0.005, 'neu': 0.901, 'pos': 0.094, 'compound': 0.9733}",positive

4,frankly after having this days and getting used to it i am utterly amazed i transferred all my settings into it from my old in minutes which sure made things a lot quicker after all these years they were still there but it is a very good thing i had not forgotten that year old defunct email address i pressed the watch tv activity and my sony hdtv onkyo receiver dish hopper dvr and pinnacle subwoofer i built an ir switch for it all clicked on it feels great in your hand and is lighter and i like the feltlike rough surface of the back however i cant lay it on the chair arm face down to keep it from slipping off there arent enuf buttons to grip it which ironically is good and sometimes it will erroneously trigger the touch screen a very minor problem but it is less likely to damage itself falling on the carpet since it doesnt weigh much id give it stars but i do not find the favorite channel screen useful the icons are too small to see well wo my reading glasses id rather just go to my guide grid on the dish hopper and select the channels there where i can see what is actually on and it is difficult to scroll up and down wo selecting the wrong channel by mistake for that matter that is a problem in selecting functions on the devices too it takes just the right touch however i just love the gesture screen controlled by swipes taps i wish it had the ability to be controlled by two fingers also so i had instead of gestures but the screen is a bit cramped for that and it requires the hub and a smartphone which is overkill for my purposes i reprogrammed of the and use the buttons instead several of which control the input of my pc in the bedroom making this old sony hdtv semismart w a wireless keyboard and mousethe adjustable vibration feedback when you complete a command is simply splendid there are also about different screen backgrounds to choose from you can even upload a pic when it is plugged into the computer and create ones own wallpaperbackgroundsmy major gripe about these logitech remotes remotes in general and i have had two before this one is the buttons wear out before the electronics and they will not sell the keypad i am a retired electronics technician so i am capable of prying apart the old and replacing it a classic example of planned obsolescence this is part of the reason i went the extra mile and got this and i am happy i did of course the main button that went bad controlled the dish and was one of the four around the little screen that are not mappable so i could not transfer it to another this model is tight as a clam and they claim the rechargeable lithium battery should never need replacing well it may last longer than i do but all batteries eventually need replacing the little stand that it recharges in either by micro usb or acdc voltage converter w micro usb is great in no time one gets into the habit of putting it back in the stand so one is less likely to misplace it and it doesnt take very long to recharge the ate batteries for breakfastthis was refurbishedrecertified and came w a qc sticker on it i got it elsewhere and it looks and functions brand new logitech handles it w a warranty like it is a brand new one and i dont think i am imagining this their customertech service seems to have improved from what i remember is a bargain when one considers the retail price of a new one this was refurbishedrecertified came w a qc sticker on it and i obtained it elsewhere it looks and functions as if brand new off the shelf logitech handles it w a warranty like it is a brand new one and i dont think i am imagining this their customertech service seems to have improved from what i remember is a bargain when one considers the retail price of a new one,"{'neg': 0.047, 'neu': 0.829, 'pos': 0.124, 'compound': 0.9955}",positive

4,honestly this remote is pretty great some argue about how the playpause buttons are at the top but i had no issue using it that way besides most of what i tried lets me use the ok and directional buttons as playpause fastforwardrewind the touch screen is pretty responsive and there isnt much delay accessing your devices or activities what sucks is that there is a limitation of device no matter if you add more of these remotes or add a hub youll get the maximum amount from the device that has the maximum limit i wish the device limit from my harmony hub combined with this harmony remote giving me a total of devices but nope logitech just wants you to buy one of the expensive remotes to have the limit even the elite has a maximum of so the maximum you could get from the most expensive remote is also they should have at least doubled that as they did with the limitsbefore i begin i would like to say this is my first time owning a smart universal remote i had one or two or so cheap universal remotes before so this is a bigger differencebattery charge it for four hours use it for about hours plenty of time to use this imo just leave it on charge when you sleep and youll be good to go throughout the day it has a charging indicator on the screen that lets you know when charging and fully charged there is a battery life indicator on the top right of the screen when the remote is out of lock screen you can charge this two ways it has a cradle but you can also use the micro usb port below the remote to charge it up the micro usb port is mostly just there to setup the remote through pc but you can charge it through micro usb port as welldesign the remote looks beauitful though it could have been better i do agree with people that the playpause fastforwardrewind buttons should have been at the bottom but honestly that isnt an issue as most of the stuff ive tried lets you use the directional and ok button as playpause fastforwardrewind but either way its pretty easy to use and feels nice in the hands i love having a remote that has both a touchscreen and physical buttons touchscreen adds more functionality and having physical buttons just feels better pressing on them number keys would have been nice but really not needed if you have ditched cable and dont plan on having an antenna and it doesnt take much effort looking at the touchscreen when entering the numbers i know some people dont like that but at least its just numbers and not an entire alphabet interface not much could be done with an interface when the screen is small its nice for a universal remote much better than what smart universal remotes had before you can change the background from a preset or upload your own through the computer overall its pretty easy to use and really no delay from going device to devicetouch screen like i mentioned before the touch screen is pretty responsive if you dont want to accidentally touch the touch screen its best to put the lock screen so you can just swipe the lock screen when you want to use it and you dont accidentally end up pressing any of the touchscreen buttons when you meant to touch the physical buttons etccustomization you can arrange the order of devices for example if you want tv all the way at top you can drag it to all the way at the top when you are in edit mode same with activities what you cant arrange is smart home devices that are in the pluglights folders you can arrange where plugs and lights go but not the devices themselves in the plugs and lights folder kinda sucks as you can do that with the harmony app but not on the remote also the arrangement you set in the harmony app doesnt get applied to the remote you have to do the arrangement separately on both the app and remote also as i said before you can also change the background image to a selection from the preset or upload your own through the computer customization is great but could be better at least its there activitiesfavorites you setup activities which lets you can turn on multiple things at once you can also for example access your favorite channels or if you have a roku your favorite apps it seems like there is only integration with roku when it comes to alexa and favorites section so for example you can launch netflix from the netflix icon in the favorite sections once you hit the roku activitylimitations it kind of sucks that there is a device limitation of devices only im sure they could have gone with a much higher limit i have a irrf hub called broadlink rm pro that doesnt have this kind of annoying limit and its much cheaper than this remote and harmony hub its only under and thats when its not on sale i also wish they would have let us combined devices in order to increase our limits such as if you have the harmony hub which carries only devices youll have from this harmony remote giving you a total device limit of the nice thing though is there does not seem to be a limit of devices you can setup for smathome such as if you have smartthings linked you can pretty much put as many devices as you likeprice its a pretty expensive remote its hard to put on this remote i guess if i paid for this remote i would have rated this differently but since i got this during the holidays for its a much better experience to me just because of thatsupport logitech has email live chat and phone support so you have many options to chat with them and they usually respond back and take care of your problems pretty welloverall i would recommend this product when its on sale for or less as is too much to ask for i like this over using a smartphone as a remote because its nice having a device that is dedicated as a remote only and nothing else smartphones have too much going for it and the lack of physical buttons dont make it as nicer to use as a dedicated remote even if you voice control for everything echogoogle home using a remote is sometimes nicer i prefer changing the volume through remote rather then through alexa but i prefer turning on the tv through alexa through anything else the amount of customization is nice but could be better having the ability to charge the remote two ways micro usb and cradle is also nice the remote has a nice design feels good in the hands but the device limitations are for the most part the weakest point i could get away with the other issues as they arent such big issues but i would have loved to control more devices without having to find workarounds overall i would recommend this remote only when its or less i cant see myself putting for any remote

4,almost a month ago i paid over for four hub based harmony logitech remotes two ultimate home remotes one white and one black and one ultimate one upgraded with the smart control and ultimate hub addoni have three av systems in my bedroom home gym and family room i used the ultimate one smart control combination in my bedroom so that my wife and i could each have a remote on our side of the bed that would stay in sync with each otheri must say that the units are beautifully packaged and have a very attractive design they feel good in the hand i am somewhat of a techie and have had various learninguniversal remotes over the years and did not find the setup difficult in fact compared to past remotes in which setup involved hours of button pushing the harmony setup was a breeze i was very impressed by the gui interface though the process of addingediting devices and activities was agonizingly slow at times because of the sluggish slowmo response of the ios app during the setup stagei was so excited to setup and deploy these remotes in the three rooms and happy to tell my family about the new convenience we would all enjoy no longer having to juggle multiple remotes and devices in each roomeverything seemed to work perfectly running the remotes through their paces after installationunfortunately the honeymoon did not last long the first night i really used the remote to watch a movie i noticed there were times when i tried to pause or rewind the playback and the commands did not work the remote was frozenup then to seconds later the commands i had given would be executed and the movie would start executing the commands the movie would pause rewind etc since i had pushed the buttons repeatedly the result was somewhat comical as the tv seemed spontaneously to be pausing fast forwarding etc as it executed the command i had given seconds ago this problem exhibited itself with the volume control and other controls as wellthe next week and a half were a nightmare dealing with first level harmony offshore tech support personnel who repeatedly ran me through timeconsuming standard troubleshooting scripts involving resting and reprogramming the remotes firmware updates submitting logs to them all with no resultfinally after multiple calls and many hours spent i was firm in demanding that the matter be escalated to upper level support personnel at first these upper level support people would not talk to me directly until i became very insistent that i had no interest in speaking further to the standard support personnel i must say however that every support person i talked to and there were many were extremely courteous in a uniform scripted sort of way you might get in a nice chain restauranti eventually found out that this is a firmware problem has existed for some time with harmony touchscreen remotes the upperlevel logitech harmony engineers are well aware of the firmware bug that causes this problem though the front line support personnel seem ignorant of the problem see the following link on the harmony support site which discusses the problem httpforumslogitechcomtharmonyhubbasedremotesmyharmonyultimateisveryslowtorespondwhenitapthetdp harmony was very reluctant to admit this problem existed so dont be surprised if the above link is taken downjust to be clear this was not just a case of having gotten one defective unit the freezingdelayed response problem was exhibited in all four of the remotes that i purchased this is a universal firmware problem affecting this entire line of touchscreen remotes and one which has been acknowledged to me by upper level harmony engineersthe upper level support engineers had me submit my logs once again and told me that a firmware update was being worked on to fix the problem they initially told me that the firmware update would be available in a couple of days then that estimate was extended to within a week two weeks later not having received notice of the update they finally conceded that they no longer had an estimated date for the firmware fix and they would be in contact with me when it was availableduring this saga i called in to the harmony support line countless times the support line is answered with a recorded greeting from the head of harmony customer experience who offers his personal email address at the end of the greeting and invites callers to email him directly if their concerns are not satisfied i started to copy this person on my email exchanges with support engineers then i wrote two emails directly to him outlining my frustrations providing incident numbers and seeking his assistance the response was crickets its been almost three weeks since i first reached out to this person and still i have received no response from him so i must conclude that the invitation to contact him directly is simply marketing bs who knows maybe he is not even a real personof course i returned all four remotes before the amazon day return window expiredseeking another alternative i found that the reviews online for the harmony remote were generally very positive call me a glutton for punishment after all the problems i had with the touch screen harmony remotes but last week i purchased two of the much cheaper harmony remotes to try out in my bedroomso far knock on wood the harmony s seem to be working out very well they are older tech and do not have all of the bells and whistles of the touch screen remotes but so far at least they seem actually to work i find that i prefer them ergonomically since they have hard number buttons which are much more convenient than the touch screen remotes which you have to swipe to unlock then swipe a second time to access the soft number buttonsif you have any components inside a cabinet you will need to utilize an ir extender kit in order to use the harmony there are several highly rated ir extender kits available on amazon for a modest price and the harmony wont control your nest thermostat or phillips hue lights if you have them but you can already control these devices from your smart phone so this is not much of a sacrificebecause of the good experience i have had this past few days with the harmony s in my bedroom i just ordered two more harmony s to replace the ultimate home remotes i had tried unsuccessfully to use in my family room and home gym my family room is a closed cabinet system so i also ordered an ir extender kit for that locationkeep in mind that i have only had the harmony s for less than a week it is possible that problems might crop up but if i end up having problems with the harmony s i pledge to update this review with that informationi seldom write reviews and have certainly never written such an extensive one but after all of the wasted hours and frustration these remotes caused me i felt somewhat of a civic duty to warn others of the serious problems they are likely to experience with these remotesupdate to prior review as of i have received support on this issue there is a firmware update that logitech has given me for the ultimate one which has for the most part fixed the delayed responsefreezeup problems that i was having previously as of the date of this update this firmware has not yet been released for the ultimate one but should be available for the ultimate home remote however if you have these problems with the ultimate one i suspect that you can get this update from tech support it should be widely available soon with this fix i can recommend the remote,"{'neg': 0.064, 'neu': 0.83, 'pos': 0.106, 'compound': 0.9925}",positive

4,logitech harmony ultimate one ir remote with customizable touch screen control logitech finally came up with a replacement for the supremely popular harmony one remote it is called the ultimate one and it is essentially the ultimate without the rf kit it is exactly that because in the software there is an upgrade offer to sell you the rf puck and cables to transform this to the ultimate it adds the missing features like controlling devices in a cabinet and setting up smart devices like an iphone to act as remotes its a good way to start out slow and add features if you need them the upgrade is one hundred dollars the same difference between the ultimate and ultimate one so its a reasonable way to expand itthe hand feel of the remote is good it isnt too heavy and its smaller than the remotes that preceded it the touch screen is larger than earlier models and there are fewer hard keys than before too i do miss some easy to use keys over the touch screen but im getting used to the overall use the screen visual quality is good but because of the layout favorite icons are smaller than before and they suffer in terms of resolution overall the screen is easy to see and the hard buttons are all backlit for easy seeing in the dark the lights all go dim by a user settable timer the afore mentioned icons can be used to set up favorite channels for one provider this is the biggest shortcoming for the current lineup of harmony remotes previously you were able to set up multiple carriers such as time warner cable and over the air and have sets of icons for each one that ended with the new software and new remotes tech support says they are considering a change but as of this writing its as it is there have been numerous updates and feature enhancements for the ultimate remote and the u takes advantage of them among the updates was the addition of a sleep timer in the remote so you can shut off the activity you are watching while falling asleep they also added the ability to add custom backgrounds in addition to the included set a good source for custom icons and soon backgrounds is iconharmony dot com using these custom graphics really helps to personalize your remotemy one main nit to pick with the hardware is the choice to seal in the battery on previous remotes logitech had issues with the battery pack expanding and they wound up replacing many remotes i dont think the solution to use a custom sealed in battery is a good choice when the battery dies you will have to mail in the remote to them or a service center not a great solution in my opinionyou program the remote with a website app at myharmony dot com on the forum they recently announced a new software offline solution is being rolled out this was how it used to be and many are happy it is coming back this is a very good but not perfect and certainly not an ultimate remote i do like it and have grown used to it including using its brother the ultimate and i do like it if i was designing it id have used a much higher resolution screen and used standard rechargeable replaceable batteries so im deducting one star but still recommend it for its usability with the vast amount of systems,"{'neg': 0.05, 'neu': 0.817, 'pos': 0.132, 'compound': 0.9945}",positive
4,i bought this remote to replace an old harmony one and so far it has been a good replacement it does not operate devices out of line of sight there has been some confusion in earlier reviews regarding this even though theres nothing in the description that says that it does which is fine for me all of my devices are behind glass and this works just fine if you need beyondlineofsight functionality youll have to spring for the more expensive version with the hubsetup was easier than my old remote the webbased setup had a better knowledge of the actual names of the inputs and outputs on my receiver so there was no trial and error as could happen with the older model all told setup took about minutes most of this was waiting for a firmware update actual defining of activities devices and inputs took only a few minutes and worked the first timeall that said the ergonomics of this remote are not as good as the old harmony one the lack of a hardware number pad is unfortunate but a reasonable tradeoff for the reduced size but the real problem is the placement of the dvr controls on the top its annoying and forces you to move your hands too much for these commonlyused controls besides this its a nice remote and i plan to use it for a long time,"{'neg': 0.066, 'neu': 0.847, 'pos': 0.088, 'compound': 0.3331}",neutral
4,very good remote controls all my devices samsung tv benq projector marantz av amp sky hd and ps with an infrared dongle if you dont have one of these this model cant control it and same for ps apparently as it requires bluetooth even a couple of obscure old gadgets are still supported even if the device is not in the database you can still learn commands from the original remote as a last resorti like the harmony remotes because of the activity concept one button can for example turn on the tv receiver and bluray player and set all the inputs to the correct setting ready to watch while turning off unused devices the more gadgets you have the more benefit you get from a device like thisthis was an upgradereplacement for an old model harmony and while i like this well enough it is more complicated in use than the old modelgeneral build quality is very good much better than the older model it feels sold and weighty in the hand the rounded back makes it easy and comfortable to hold but it wobbles around on the coffe table the remote slides easily into the charging dock and as the used to chew through batteries this is much better however the battery in the remote is not easily replaceable so i hope it has reasonable longevitythe feel of the backlit hard buttons is very good with a nice positive click much better than the old dead flesh rubber buttons on the the dpad and navigation buttons are well placed and easy to use but the main playpauseffrw controls are a bit awkwardly placed but still useablethe touch screen display provide customisable soft buttons and obviously conveys much more information than the tiny monochrome lcd on the old model but as it is a capacitive type like a smartphone it is very sensitive and easy to hit the wrong softkey the remote beeps and vibrates when a touch screen button is used but its not as positive as a real button and you have to look at the remote you cant navigate by feelfortunately the touch screen is used mostly for secondary functions and the hard keys cover the typical primary controls number keys are only touchscreen buttons and therefore more difficult to use than real buttons but favourite sky channels can be shown as a colourful page of icons which is easier than remembering the channel number however to be honest if you are like me you use the sky guide page anyway which only needs the direction pad to navigate to be fair after a few weeks i really have put away all the original remotes as i dont need them so this device does the jobthe programming software is pretty easy to use a bit quirky in some ways but since i was used to the old version i found it easy enough and the new version is an improvement also unlike the old model a certain amount of customisation can be done directly on the remote without using a pc at all you can do a basic set up in a few minutes but you will probably need a couple of hours to set it up perfectly of you have several devices to control,"{'neg': 0.032, 'neu': 0.766, 'pos': 0.202, 'compound': 0.9985}",positive

4,i negotiated one of these directly from logitech as a replacement for a harmony one that developed the swelling battery issue and became dangerous to use at first logitech refused to replace but i was persistent and it paid offmy review followsi have only had this unit for a few days but so far i like it its a completely different concept than their old remotes the software is new and you program for your area and you service provider so far so goodmy first issue was my zip code about years ago the usps in its infinite wisdom changed my zip code four years later logitech hasnt yet caught up when i entered my zip code nothing then on a whim i entered my old zip code one that doesnt exist anymore and bingo it was recognizedthe programming from there was tedious but pretty easy te remote allows you to select up to of your favorite channels and you chose them from a touch screen using icons that identify the channel and also shows the channel number you can also arrange these icons in any order you want the icons are small and some are hard to read what this means to me is that i no longer have to use directtvs channel guide to locate the channel number and then enter that on a keypad on the remote i simply scroll on the touch screen until i find the channel i want and tap the remote has made a few mistakes but generally its pretty good and choosing the correct channel it does save time there is also the option of a numeric touch screen for those instances where you want to enter a numeric number i dont think i will be using the numeric key pad much also during the programming there was an instance where logitechs software hadnt picked up the complete channel lineup but there is a provision that allowed me to manually enter it albeit with a generic icon so far it works for meas a final thought as i mentioned earlier this was a replacement for a harmony one that had a swelled battery and had become dangerious to use because of excessive heat coming from the remote the battery in the harmony one is in a nacelle and once it starts to swell its impossible to remove i know i tried i also have a harmony that battery had also started to swell but the battery is mounted in a conventional way and it was easily changed i guess logitech is worried about this going forward because the battery in the ultimate one is not thats right is not replaceable the instructions say that when the unit reached end of life who knows when that is you dismantle destroy the unit and remove the battery for disposali dont believe this is the proper solution on an electrical item that has a list price of,"{'neg': 0.037, 'neu': 0.842, 'pos': 0.121, 'compound': 0.9911}",positive

5,i bought this keyboard solely because i liked how it felt in the store when i typed compared to the type cover i purchased with my surface pro over a year ago id spent time typing on this one in the store and thought i knew what to expect boy was i wrong first yes the keyboard is exponentially more comfortable and feels somehow faster than the older type cover second wow the trackpad this is by far the smoothest and most perfectly tuned trackpad i have ever used the default sensitivity for both movement and taptoclick is perfect third the fingerprint id is more useful than id expected in addition to the windows functionality i already knew about it also works as a login feature for my password manager and im sure much more that i havent discovered yet finally lets talk about cringe lapability the keyboards magnetic attachment to the screen feels stronger and the whole keyboard feels more rigid and solid than my older type cover the end result is a device configuration that very closely mimics the stable feeling of a decent laptop overall this keyboard made my surface pro new again in short this upgrade for my surface pro works perfectly and offers improvements i wasnt expecting ill be honest and say that i almost never use my old touch cover anymore i just didnt like it this however i will use its one of those things i didnt realize i needed until i got it if youre a surface pro owner and youre looking for a way to refresh that system and make it feel new again this works well,"{'neg': 0.024, 'neu': 0.799, 'pos': 0.177, 'compound': 0.9915}",positive

5,purchased this product to mount my new panasonic plasma tv model tcpgt wanted a fully articulating mount so i could move it easily to adjust viewing angle as well as access connections on back of the tv and also wanted a slim profile so it would sit as close to the wall as possible when fully retracted this mount does all of these things well i was originally looking at the vlf which appeared very similar to the vlf except the vlf only accomodates tvs up to and costs less so i emailed sanus asking about the difference and one of the reps immediately replied and asked that i call him so he could explain he told me that the vlf is the second generation of the vlf and offers improved balancing of large tvs this made sense because i did recall seeing a few customer reviews of the vlf saying that their tvs wouldnt hang perfectly level of course this begs the question of why they are still selling the vlf when they have admitted it needed to be updated anyway i needed to mount my tv centered between two windows but the two studs i had to use were exactly four inches off center of where the mount neeeded to be hung since the vlf has multiple predrilled slots which are designed to accomodate studs between and apart i was able to use two unmatching slots to compensate for three of those four inches but this still left me with the mount being one inch offcenter between my two windows to get that last inch i hung the tv on the mount and then simply slid the tv one inch to the left so it was hanging one inch offcenter of the mount but perfectly centered between my two windows problem solved no the lb tv would eversoslightly tilt to the left since it was hanging offcenter so much for nd generation improvement of the mount it still has very little tolerance for tvs not hanging perfectly centered undeterred and deciding that the tv was hanging about lower than where i really wanted it i started over and installed the mount higher and intentionally a bit offlevel to the right so when i reinstalled the tv one inch to the left of center on the mount it hung perfectly bottom line the multiple predrilled mounting slots give you some flexibility to accomodate offcenter studs but if you need more than or inches of wiggle room then be prepared to take more creative action,"{'neg': 0.056, 'neu': 0.882, 'pos': 0.061, 'compound': -0.4161}",neutral

5,ive heard quite a few bluetooth speakers some better than others but one thing they all lacked was good bass output well that has been more than solved here but its not just about bass here the overall sound quality is outstanding and while were talking about how great it is how about full alexa control built in as well yup that too connectivity to pandora iheart spotify another others as well ensure you will get plenty of choices when it comes to music in the box is the of course the bt speaker power adapter usb cable quick start guide and in my case i got the charging dock as well for free im not sure but this might be a best buy thing the speaker itself is a nice graphite color that should match most home entertainment set ups there is also a blue one if you want something a little more blingier probably not a word but you get what i mean it weighs almost pounds which i assume is because the speaker has some decent drivers to get that the incredible bass it puts out set up is fairly easy just download the ultimate ears app from your devices app store log into your amazon account turn speaker on and follow the instructions to get the speaker and alexa features all set up you can also use manual set up via long pressing the power button for pairing to your chosen device as stated before one of the coolest features this has over some other bt speakers is voice control so in addition to a bass rocking speaker you can use it for all sorts off voice commands weather updates play pause music etc and to top all of this off it is ip waterproof for up to minutes in of water accidentally drop it in your tub while having a relaxing bath kicked into your pool while playing poolside no problem the initial charge can take up to hours and is rated for up to hours so a full day should be no problem at all and if you have the dock as well just keep it on the dock and never have to worry about charging it all day music with alexa their anytime you need it this is by far the best sounding and most feature rich bluetooth speaker i have ever heard and will be recommending it to anyone looking for a nice gift this holiday season the name ultimate is definitely deserved here it is the ultimate bluetooth wifi speaker for sure,"{'neg': 0.046, 'neu': 0.751, 'pos': 0.203, 'compound': 0.9978}",positive
5,i have been completely blown away by the performance of this new megablast portable speaker by ultimate ears i currently own a boom speaker which is a previous generation of portable speaker from ultimate ears and this megablast speaker is a vast improvement in every way the megablast looks fairly similar in style to the boom with the same cylindrical shape and rubbery feel to the buttons it is much larger than the boom it is advertised as waterproof and this held true when it was tested in a bathtub this makes it great for outdoor situations especially for the pool boat or camping the megablast has farfield voice recognition reacting to my voice commands from very far away inside and outside it can connect either via wifi or bluetooth it is compatible with alexa voice which allows it respond to all of the typical alexa questions and commands the speaker currently works with amazon music iheartradio tunein through the alexa app via bluetooth you can connect to your phone and play music from the various music services that are out there there is a free ultimate ears app that will need to be downloaded to your phone which walks the user through connecting the speaker and logging in to amazon and other music services the speaker does come with a dring micro usb cord and power adapter i also obtained the ultimate ears power up charging dock which works nicely with the speaker the power up charging dock works with both megablast and blast speakers but not the previous generation of speakers like the boom for me a single charge lasted about fifteen hours now about the sound it is amazing and comes out in all directions compared to my old boom music sounds more full and rich even at loud volume levels the improvement in the bass is the most noticeable music has real weight to it that you just dont hear with other portable speakers thanks to the improved bass drivers the highs the midrange and the lows just sound so good i have really enjoyed using the megablast it is easy to use has quality sound and allows me to use alexa if you are looking for a quality portable speaker i highly recommend the ultimate ears megablast,"{'neg': 0.005, 'neu': 0.853, 'pos': 0.142, 'compound': 0.9951}",positive
5,if this were a new device i would perhaps write a lengthy review but instead it is the fusionupgrade of a product that has been around for a few years my best friend received the original echo back when it first launched and it was pretty sweet though something i didnt really feel the need to own especially since i didnt think it was that great of a speaker i have several bluetooth speakers but i am always looking for the next and best with the ultimate ears megablast i feel like i have found that speakerthe ue megablast you just have to put that in all caps is an outstanding bluetooth speaker it is by far the clearest and probably loudest speaker i have every owned minus my old component system back in the day add to that the alexa functionality and it makes this a nobrainer i do a lot of cooking and my wife likes to bake so to now have a speaker that we can command with our voices and can fill the entire lower floor of our house with great music is a wonderful thing i probably wont be using all of the features of alexa but i have already enjoyed checking the local traffic and weather in the mornings before heading out to workim betting i will also never have the opportunity to fully test out the waterproofing since i plan to keep this inside most of the time and i dont have a pool but since it is in the kitchen i at least dont have to worry about it getting splashedsetup was a breeze i didnt even do it the right way and was still up and running in less than minutes i plugged in the megaboom and paired it with my iphone and the phone prompted me to download the ultimate ears app once that was downloaded it did a quick sec firmware update and i was ready to sign into my amazon account seconds later i had the speaker jamming out some def leppard and i was goodi highly recommend the power up base accessory since it makes it a lot easier to keep this thing charged since you just have to leave or drop it on the dock the white base is nice and i actually didnt even have to use the brick that the megablast came with i just have the usb cord going into a power port built into my plug outlet no muss and no fuss when i want to take it outside or to the beach i can just grab it and go and know that it is charged up ue says that you can get hours on a charge and i have yet to test that out but it has gone strong for over so farif you have been thinking about getting an alexa capable device and have been holding off dont ultimate ears has created a top notch bluetooth speaker that deserves to be bought just for that but then ices the cake by adding amazon alexa functionality,"{'neg': 0.035, 'neu': 0.789, 'pos': 0.175, 'compound': 0.9979}",positive

5,the megablast is a great sounding speaker that gets very loud db without distorting its quite heavy so even though its portable you will definitely know youre hauling it around i highly recommend the power up base for convenience and because charging is a bit wonky without it the charging port is located on the bottom under a flap alexa works flawlessly except when the volume is high which is to be expected as of right now ue and amazon are teaming up to give you free months of amazon music unlimited family plan which is a nice bonus unlike prior ue speakers theres no party mode over bluetooth but it is available as long as you are on wifi setting up the speaker is very easy when using the app and direct bluetooth pairing is painless the only thing id fault with this unit is the seeming inability to adjust the bass mid and treble levels even a basic equalizer would be nice to have at higher volumes the bass tends to drop off and the sound gets too tweeter heavy for my tastes putting the speaker nearer a wall or corner alleviates this some but thats not always ideal the degree sound output is quite handy and im looking forward to using this during pool season especially since its waterproof overall ive been quite impressed and would highly consider buying another one in the near future,"{'neg': 0.057, 'neu': 0.807, 'pos': 0.135, 'compound': 0.9362}",positive

5,there are great bluetooth speakers great amazon echo devices and now something that combines both ive been using a couple of echo dots for over a year now and have gotten hooked on using them for home automation as well as listening to news football games and music i had been using an external bluetooth speaker with each in order to make the music sound tolerable ive now replaced the dot and speaker combo in the kitchen with the megablast and its perfecthere are some features i really likeo i keep it sitting on the charging disk so its powered on and ready to move if i want to take it with me while washing cars or working in the yardo its waterproof so i dont have to worry about splashing it in the kitchen or yardo it says the battery will last hours which is way longer than i want to be doing yard worko the sound quality is fantastic its really clear even at high volume with no distortion that i can detect it never sounded muddy or tinny like some speakerso a nice perk is that it comes with months of free amazon music unlimited i have prime but there are occasionally songs ive wanted that are only in the unlimited service itll be nice to try it out and see how much i use itthere is really only one slight negative with the speaker that i found the indicator light on top is recessed and this is the light that lets you know if alexa is listening to you if youre across the room sometimes you dont have a high enough angle to see the light and i found that annoying i guess i really did get used to watching the light ring on the echo dot so i miss being able to see that across the room however i think the quality speaker sound more than makes up for that loss its great to have alexa in a portable waterproof quality speaker,"{'neg': 0.046, 'neu': 0.849, 'pos': 0.106, 'compound': 0.9165}",positive

5,hands down this is the best bluetooth speaker ive heard since everyones listening tastes differ you mileage may vary theres more than enough bass tight and slightly punchy that you can feel and the midshighs are more pronounced and crisp and with any speaker the quality that goes in is reflected in the quality that comes out so your spotify extreme downloads will sound better than the music ripped from napster in theres more than enough headroom to overwhelm a small x room but a large room wouldnt be a problem either as its winter in my locale i havent tested outdoor results but fidelity will obviously be lost as is the case with any speaker absent any reflective surfacesyeah its a fairly large speaker but id have no problem putting it into a carryon to accompany me on a vacation solid build and finishi put this up against bbs standard aisle fare and it really stood out for me with its superior sound i walked into the store expecting to buy the large bose revolve but didnt like its sound characteristics nearly enough that may be the right speaker for you so take the opportunity to do an instore listen before purchasing the other ue offerings just didnt have the clarity and sound i wanted although others can be paired up for stereo sound which would make a difference in the end i just wanted one speaker and this was itand if you want a decent carry case search amazon for telephoto camera lens bags i think mine jjc was about and carries the charge cable and wall wart with the speaker with ease what can be improvedwifi connectivity is spotty for whatever reason it stopped connecting to my primary wifi network but has no problem with the guest one go figurethe microphones arent nearly as sensitive as my alexa devices in fact i have to raise my voice enough that other devices pick up the requests toobluetooth doesnt autoconnect in the app its just a couple clicks but i can be listening to music open the app and it wont find the speaker until i select it in the menu dumbthe recharge port is kinda in a dumb place on the bottom protected by a threaded cover makes sense for durability but im sure more than one owner will lose hisher cover or threaded boltue could stand to add an eq setting in the app but im running eq pro on my android and that launches automatically so nbd still it would be nice if a speaker manufacturer had the forethought to allow customizing its products sound without going thirdparty again just a nit but i like messing with the soundgood luck with your search and happy listening,"{'neg': 0.057, 'neu': 0.829, 'pos': 0.115, 'compound': 0.9827}",positive

5,theres a few things a person should know about this stereo before purchasing it one if you dont have an iphone you are basically buying a very expensive amfm radio for those with an iphone though this stereo offers the simplest utilization of carplay over any other option you plug in your iphone and carplay opens no submenus to work through its just there you also have an aux option that works with video if your car is in park that you can add a dvd player cd player xm radio or hd radio tosecond a number of other reviews have pointed out that there is no bluetooth thats technically correct but there is a chance of that changing in the near future the reason why there is no bluetooth currently is because carplay has no wireless option but with ios launching in the fall that will be added and the ilx is prepared to take advantage of it with a chip included within that is either wifi or wifibluetooth hybrid either way alpine is apparently prepared to release a firmware update andor bluetooth dongle to make the ilx wireless in the fall pioneer is telling customers that their stereos will not be wireless compatible so thats a big plus for alpine if it comes to passoverall though i enjoy my ilx and dont regret purchasing it its very minimalist has a capacitive screen and a physical siri button i was also able to hook a backup camera to it and steering wheel controls work with it with an adapter if youre looking for the same things i was in a double din stereo namely carplay this is the one to get its a great unit that may get even greater in the near future,"{'neg': 0.029, 'neu': 0.881, 'pos': 0.09, 'compound': 0.9598}",positive

5,you can start a party anywhere with this speaker thanks to the builtin light showpros sound quality obviously one of the most important features of a speaker is the sound quality the sony xb certainly does not disappoint highs and mids come through clear and bass had some kick to it if its not enough for you you can press the extra bass button for an enhanced effect i tested streaming music from apple music pandora and slacker radio and was not disappointed with the sound quality of this speaker lights i know some may find this gimmicky but i really like the lights on this speaker there is the outer ring that surrounds the speaker on the front that changes different colors and two white led strobe lights on either side you can set the lights to dance with the music set a more calming lighting effect or turn off the lights completely by using the songpal app the lights really to add a bit of a party atmosphere and helps this speaker stand out from other brands bass booster a quick press of extra bass button substantially increases lows and adds a great bass effect especially considering the size of this speaker however it can make some songs sound a little muddy with an overemphasis on lows nfc pairing if your phone features an nfc chip it can be used to quickly pair to this speaker with a tap speakerphone support you can answer incoming calls on this speaker by tapping the phone button i tested this out and my friend said the sound quality was very good and he could hear me fine however if i stepped too far to one side the noise cancellation feature seems to kick in and makes my voice harder to hear so be sure youre in front of the speaker while using the phone feature siri support you can also call up siri by tapping the phone button and speaking a command bluetooth standby a unique feature of this speaker is that you can leave it plugged in to an ac outlet and it will automatically turn on when you start playing music on your phone it will go into standby mode waiting for the next time you play music if nothing plays for a period of time this feature can be enabled in songpal app charge your phone the speaker has a usb port on the back you can use your own charging cable to plug into this port and charge your phone while the speaker is on this would obviously decrease the runtime of the speaker but it can come in handy in a pinch pair with other sony xb speakers another unique feature is the ability to pair this bluetooth speaker with another similar sony bluetooth speaker the other speakers must support the wireless party chain function which currently includes the srsxb srsxb and srsxb up to speakers can be connected aux in nonbluetooth devices can be used by using an audio cable with stereo mini plugs not includedcons proprietary charger unfortunately this speaker cannot be recharged with a standard micro usb or usbc charger it uses a barrel connector meaning that you need to remember to bring the included charger with you and make sure you dont lose it fully charging the speaker takes about hours no battery life indicator on ios many newer bluetooth speakers display their battery level on the iphoneipad status bar so you can see when your speaker needs recharged this sony xb speaker does not do that although you can use the songpal app to find it its buried under the settings option in the app you can also hold down the phone button for about seconds and the speaker will announce its current charge buggy songpal app this speaker seems to use a separate bluetooth connection when using the app as i frequently receive messages from the songpal app that my speaker needs to be paired even while it is currently streaming music from the same device ive also seen multiple instances of the speaker appear in the app even though im only using one so it looks like the songpal app has some kinks to work outoverall im really happy with the sound quality of this speaker and the light show is a nice added bonus,"{'neg': 0.031, 'neu': 0.85, 'pos': 0.119, 'compound': 0.9967}",positive

5,there are very few things these days that are worth every penny this pair of headphones is one of them the sound quality is as good as all the other reviews indicate so i wont recreate the wheel i have tinnitus and sometimes its difficult for me to hear the tv or stream a tv show or movie without having to turn the sound up probably why i have tinnitus i live in a condo and playing music tv or movies loud is not an option these headphones help to focus the sound to my ears rather than the whole room let alone the building i dont have to play them loud to enjoy the sound or hear the words they tend to get a little snug but not so much as to outweigh the overall sound quality as for the quality of construction and materials you get what you pay for the leather is soft and supple not plasticy or sticky on the skin the metal parts are well made and give the headphones a very nice appearance and feel and finally i have a big fat head i gave away my beatsmonster headphones because they were too tight on my head these headphones have plenty of room for my massive cranium and are comfortable to wear for the length of a moviei love my headphones,"{'neg': 0.027, 'neu': 0.862, 'pos': 0.111, 'compound': 0.9658}",positive

5,man do these make one heck of a first impression removing the lid of the box greets you with the unmistakable smell of brand new genuine leather from the thick headband to the ear cups this baby is soft premium leather all the way the metal frame that connects them is strong and gives confidence that theyre not going to accidentally bend or break from anything but an almost intentional force against them heres my first comparison to its peers most every other set even over is almost completely plastic this is solid metal and leather through and through thats already a striking difference and makes a good argument for a higher price tag its obviously a higher quality product with better materials i also like that the ear cups are removable and magnetically attached should there be an unrepairable break or tear just buy a new set and pop them on underneath the left cup is where the cord attaches this is also a great idea as the port tends to get damaged when the cord is pulled or water seeps in you can tell there was a lot of thought put towards the design the picture doesnt do these justice they impress from top to bottom one thing they dont look like is something you want to sweat all over or wear on rainy days so have something else for gyms sweltering heat and storm season outdoors theyre also much more comfortable than they look the ear pads are filled with memory foam so theyre very soft to the touch and the headband is also nicely padded i also like the added thickness on top while they did feel a little clampy when i first put them on i never felt any real discomfort during my hours of wearing them they also seal very well and isolate from most of the outside noise theyre easily the best noise isolating headphones ive ever put on they fold in on both sides to fit easier in a small bag or case making them more portable the ear cups dont swivel thoughill be honest here about the sound i have to say i was a little disappointed at first i cycled through a variety of different types of music and when comparing them directly against my audio technica mxs they didnt blow them away which is what i was kind of expecting them to do given their price point and reputation i then realized that it wasnt a realistic expectation because my mxs are actually very good headphones and nothing is going to make them sound like garbage i thought the ps would outperform them so well that id just ditch them completely well that didnt happen in fact im now convinced that its probably not wise to expect any competent set of headphones to be rendered obsolete by a more expensive set like these if you have a good set already thats at least over to and up by well established companies like sennheiser vmoda beyerdynamic bose audio technica etc intentionally omitting the over priced and overrated beats the ps wont completely redefine good sound for you at least they didnt for me once i got over that i focused in on what they are and what they do well as much as what they do differently than what i already have my mxs are just a slight notch above neutral in bass and treble with no mids which is something i like about them these are a different flavor altogether the mids and lows are much more pronounced pushing vocals to the forefront beck was practically singing right in front of my face when i played some of his music stringed instruments in classical and jazz genres also received a big boost from the extra attention cellos harps and stand up basses were much fuller than my other set ever told me bass kicked electronic music daft punk deadmau up a few notches over my ats as well but never got overbearing or obnoxious i really like the deeper bass and thicker overall sound on bass heavy music but im not a bass head so i dont want bass drowning out the instruments and vocals either it sounds like its right on the threshold of going over the edge but never getting there i like a lot of rock music too which is something my ats can do very well a few bands actually sounded better on them than on the ps which is probably due to the treble coming down a couple of notches i prefer a v shaped sound favoring the treble and bass in fact i usually have the treble dialed all the way up on my eqs so i missed that high sizzle from cymbals and snap from the snare drums i also couldnt distinguish all the instruments as well on harder tunes with heavier distortion on the guitars the push to the mids made the sound fuller but muddied the separation a little more for most everything the ps did everything better and outperformed my mxs they just came up a little short a few times according to my tastesoutside of music the ps also worked great with tv shows and movies vocals came through clearly and soundtracks and effects delivered a more home theater like experience the extra oomph really delivered on action scenes and dialog was more distinguishablethere are cords provided and the one attached for apple devices included controls that worked flawlessly with my ipad and ipod the cord even feels better in comparison to others ive felt my one drawback is the included case while its nice to receive one and it is of the same fine leather as found on the headphones im not a fan of soft cases especially not for expensive electronics itll do fine for around the house or light travel use but if youre going to put these in a suitcase or travel far and frequently id have my reservations im ordering a hard case for just such uses these are well worth a little extra money to protect them from falls drops getting sat on or being crushed by other bags the included soft case also looks more like one of my wifes makeup bags which is a bit of a turn off thats a very minor gripe thoughin conclusion these are premium luxury headphones the look like it feel like it smell like it and sound like it if you use or have already invested in a decent set of headphones they wont completely redefine portable listening for you but theyll provide you with a quality product thats head and shoulders above everything else ive seen on the store shelves i probably wouldve had some buyers remorse had i paid the original asking price for these but at on cyber monday it would take a lot to convince me that theres a better made and sounding headphone than the bw p this is one of those rare times where getting what you pay for turns out to be a good thing highly recommended for music listeners and those who appreciate a little luxury every now and thennote after cyber monday the ps went up to which looks like their new standard asking price that still seems like a pretty good deal and keeps them at the top of the heap in that price range,"{'neg': 0.039, 'neu': 0.781, 'pos': 0.18, 'compound':

5,i used my bose qci as my primary noise cancelling headphones for a long time but became frustrated with the in ear style so i decided to pickup an overtheear set it boiled down the offering by bose beats and jbli noticed these in the sunday ad and how they were a best buy exclusive so i went down to a store to check it out they have a really nice display that worked which went a long way if you have been to stores sometimes this is not the casebefore i tried them on i did a quick google search for some details and it came up with all the of marketing splash it is all words until you try them out in my opinion what struck me initially trying them on is the seal around the ears they are very comfortable on the ears and seal very well after wearing the headset for about an hour it starts to fatigue the top of the head looks like they chose to make the ear the comfortable spot which is finethe audio sounds great comparable with the beats in a good way i am not a fan of the sound of the bose headphones they have that bose sound which is like audio doritos always the same consistent sound but never blows you away lol the nxtgen active noise cancelling technology is very interesting having come from bose i had very high expectations and i would say that jbl has met those expectations and exceeded them in a few key ways namely the ambient awareness this feature is cool in that it allows you to hear what is going on around you to a degree based on preference this would have been perfect for studying with my cohort back in school when you wanted to kill all of the background nonsense but wanted to still be able to hear someone crack a joke or ask an interesting question on a tough problemi think one of the coolest parts of this product is the app that you can download i did not even know about it until i googled it and it makes all the difference you can set your own eq turn onoff the noise cancel and set the level of the ambient aware independently for each each with is great the hearing in my left ear sucks from driving with the window down all the time so it is nice to customize to each eari attached some pictures of the app one of the other cool things which i still do not understand how they do it but it is called trunote i guess it measures your head and tunes the headphones for it i really like this feature as i usually am wearing glasses of some kind so this really helps when they are on i did an ab comparison with it on and off it the music was especially clear when i used the trunote calibrationthe builtin mic is okay but it seems like it is too far up on the headset for it to be really legit it works but i would say that i get better performance from the qci hanging dongle thingyi would recommend this to anyone looking at a price range headset that wants great sound and utility i cannot stress the utility enough the app really makes this headset very versatile whether for use in the office to drone out the hvac that always runs or for general listening in any situation,"{'neg': 0.05, 'neu': 0.772, 'pos': 0.178, 'compound': 0.9983}",positive

5,first and foremost dont buy headphones based on reviews sound quality is subjective take your own music source and go compare headphones instore listen to your favorite genretracks and allow your ears time to become accustom to the sound with each headsetmy requirement were for good quality wireless headphones i had initially considered the sony mdrxs after reading many factorable reviews upon listening these proved very disappointing the lower range was over emphasized with poor clarity in the mid and high range using the same sound source i progressed to the bose soundlinks and the jbl elite the bose soundlinks just didnt seem to work for me whilst these felt very comfortable to wear the build felt a little cheap from a sound perspective the soundstage felt confined leaving you under no misapprehension that you were wearing headphones they conveyed a definate biased towards the mid and high range yet lacking clarity and precision the base response left something to be desiredmoving on to the jbl elite these felt more substantial in construction the ear padding was certainly firmer and whilst heavier than the bose soundlinks didnt feel that way once on the soundstage was very open inviting and exhibiting exceptional clarity across the range with a good base response turning up the volume it was easy to become completely immersed in the music and forget i was standing in a best buy store listening to music via headphones i was that impressedwhile the requirement was for wireless headphones i also tried the bose qcs which were certainly far superior to the soundlinks exhibiting a much clearer sound with better response across the range had the soundlinks performed in the the same way i would have been hard pressed to make a decisionin summary if youre looking for a wireless headset the jbls are hard to beat but then again thats my opinion go try some and decide for yourself,"{'neg': 0.04, 'neu': 0.866, 'pos': 0.094, 'compound': 0.9281}",positive

5,following in the prestigious heritage of the everest line from jbl the elite sits upon the top of its family of lifestyle consumer headphones though not a new type of product in this day and a age it is still a first from jbl offering a headphone with a wellrounded feature set to ensure these will satisfy your needs in nearly all scenariosthe packaging is typical of a premium headphone offering that grand appearance once you open the flap to reveal the contents the elite s is nicely presented in a cut out once removed you can lift the box in which inside is where the zipper carrying pouch is located this pouch is primarily good for scratch protection as it does not have any reinforcements to absorb impact damage kind of a bummer because when spending this much on headphones you would want a case to truly protect them from everyday mishaps beneath the box is the one button standard to mm auxiliary that can allow the elite to be used passively in case the battery dies next up is the micro usb cable to charge andor sync the elite to a computer to update the firmware lastly we have the warranty and quick start guide documentationthe comfort here is excellent for the most part with super plush ear pads that uniquely contour to the back of the ear by raising up slightly ear pad diameter opening is also adequate however the headband seems to distribute the rather heavier than average weight of the elite to small area on the top of the head causing discomfort after prolonged periods of useon the bottom right ear cup you can find the mm input jack the micro usb charge and sync port as well as the builtin microphone turn it over and you will find the power button located on the top and the smart button which can either toggle on and off anc or the three levels of awareness mode located on the bottom moving over to the left ear cup reveals the volume up button the playpause answerhangup phone calls and voice assistant button and the volume down buttonthe elite has a companion app which can be downloaded free from the app store or google play store functionality is nice and the way to execute is straightforward and intuitive you can quickly toggle on and off the anc as well as configure if you want the awareness modes to activate reversing the mics to let you hear what is going on around you it can be adjusted for ear independently or in a preset category of low medium or high or off you can adjust the frequencies in this eq area by either selecting from a preset or customizing your own moving back you can disable or enable the auto off feature when there is no music playing or voice prompts and configure what the smart button on the elite will trigger lastly you can activate trunote which measures the acoustical space between the eardrum and the speaker to ensure the response is optimal to minimize any unwanted resonance and distortionsi am just going to get straight to the point and say it the elite is as of today my favorite overall headphone and i never expected them to be i was merely curious from seeing their kiosk in bestbuy and having respect for jbl as a brand to care what these have to offer as well as i figured hey i have a day return window whats there to lose well these are the first bluetooth headphones i have owned that did not make me immediately want to plug them in to hear them at their full potential the wireless mode alone is simply excellent the anc does take a hit to the sound primarily in the sense of space and dynamics and resolution but it is more than listenable and when in a noisy environment is absolutely heaven the anc ability of the elite is roughly close to the qc but not quite there with anc off these sound great because these have a companion app to allow adjustments to the tonal balance i really cannot say how they sound in terms of a frequency response but in stock they sound very neutral with a slight tilt to being warm very slight i will just describe the characteristics of each frequency and to start it off the bass is tight quick and can deliver a healthy amount of sub bass it does run out of steam and distort when the sub bass is pushed to high levels that my vmoda crossfade wireless can handle with ease but overall the elite has a tighter and slightly more textured bass than the crossfade wireless the elite conveys a midrange that is open clean articulated and offers a nice depth to the point where sometimes i truly cannot believe i am using a wireless headphone no wireless headphones that i have tried has delivered this level of detail and clarity none treble once again is clean and if i had to nitpick it is not as clean and refined as say my best portables in this regard such as the bowers wilkins p or fidelio l for a wireless headphone this is honestly quite amazing when the elite is wired they improve slightly immediately ranking them up there with the best portables i have heard in terms of resolution and clarity from the stellar hour battery life to the nicely designed companion app to give me the ability to tune the sound the way i want to hear the music down to what seems like an exceptional design in acoustical engineering has rocketed these unsuspected headphones to the top of my recommendation list,"{'neg': 0.024, 'neu': 0.826, 'pos': 0.15, 'compound': 0.9989}",positive

5,i was looking for nice over the ear wireless headphones i read tons of reviews and everything was leading me to the bose qc after listening to them in the store i was impressed with the richness of the sound but didnt really want noise cancelling ive got a pair of bose in ear for that purpose and those are simply the best at blocking out unwanted soundmuch better than the qc models imho they didnt block out a lot of noise in the store and the noise cancelling seemed a bit overbearing i started trying different models in the store and literally stumbled upon the jbls it didnt take long for me to be totally impressed with the sound quality and full richness of the sound i was going to the the nonanc model but they were out of stock this one was close in price so i splurged a bit im glad i did anc its really not that useful i does block out some ambient sound while music is playing and gives a bit more focus to the music really does it drown out voices or other louder noises no this is very minimal effect the nice thing is that the music sounds precisely the same with it on or off the anc can easily be switched off while preserving the sound quality if anything id say the anc might clean up the music a bit but its not so processed that it changes the sound for louder volumes youd be hardpressed to tell if its on or off if youre looking for serious noise cancellation this is not the one to get the packaging is very nice and top notch as a surprise there is a carrying case included just a pouch and not hard sided but a nice pouch that is not at all cheap looking or feeling kudos for that the sound its great really great full and rich and not at all processed sounding its really nice deep bass clear highs really cant tell that this is not plugged in as the sound is superb even at full volume there is never any punch to the base just a nice low rumble the highs never screech but get delivered with nice clarity the mids and voices are clear and right where they should be jbl did this right the app on the phone has preset equalizer settings or you can create your own custom profile more than one the bluetooth has great range and doesnt skip a beat the battery percentage shows up near the bluetooth icon on my iphone it paired quickly and without any issues i just got these a few hours ago so cant really comment on the battery life just yet plugged in with the included cable the sound is exactly the same so far as i can tell that is as long as they are switched on when switched off they will work but there is a drop in quality when a cable is plugged in bluetooth is shut off immediately when the cable gets unplugged bluetooth switches back on right away and it reconnects with the phone the sizeweight is a lot these are not small and can be a bit heavy resting on the top of your head the padding is there but could be more to alleviate some pressure could just be me as ive not had over the ear headphones in a long time but worth mentioning here another really nice thing is that with the app i could update the firmware over bluetooth i think previous models were windows pc only but this updated easily and without a problem some have said that the lag when watching videos is terrible must have been a firmware thing because there is positively no lag at all after just a short amount of time im quite impressed and happy with my purchase not so sure about the white color but for some strange reason is a lot less in price over the black ones so i saved the money at bestbuy they have a display where you can plug in your phone and listen to your own music or a preset playlist on the display i highly recommend doing that and comparing the same songs or videos with multiple models forget these reviews as sound is highly subjective just dont pass these up as they really are a very nice yet may be overlooked for beast or bose,"{'neg': 0.065, 'neu': 0.75, 'pos': 0.185, 'compound': 0.9988}",positive

5,following in the prestigious heritage of the everest line from jbl the elite sits upon the top of its family of lifestyle consumer headphones though not a new type of product in this day and a age it is still a first from jbl offering a headphone with a wellrounded feature set to ensure these will satisfy your needs in nearly all scenariosthe packaging is typical of a premium headphone offering that grand appearance once you open the flap to reveal the contents the elite s is nicely presented in a cut out once removed you can lift the box in which inside is where the zipper carrying pouch is located this pouch is primarily good for scratch protection as it does not have any reinforcements to absorb impact damage kind of a bummer because when spending this much on headphones you would want a case to truly protect them from everyday mishaps beneath the box is the one button standard to mm auxiliary that can allow the elite to be used passively in case the battery dies next up is the micro usb cable to charge andor sync the elite to a computer to update the firmware lastly we have the warranty and quick start guide documentationthe comfort here is excellent for the most part with super plush ear pads that uniquely contour to the back of the ear by raising up slightly ear pad diameter opening is also adequate however the headband seems to distribute the rather heavier than average weight of the elite to small area on the top of the head causing discomfort after prolonged periods of useon the bottom right ear cup you can find the mm input jack the micro usb charge and sync port as well as the builtin microphone turn it over and you will find the power button located on the top and the smart button which can either toggle on and off anc or the three levels of awareness mode located on the bottom moving over to the left ear cup reveals the volume up button the playpause answerhangup phone calls and voice assistant button and the volume down buttonthe elite has a companion app which can be downloaded free from the app store or google play store functionality is nice and the way to execute is straightforward and intuitive you can quickly toggle on and off the anc as well as configure if you want the awareness modes to activate reversing the mics to let you hear what is going on around you it can be adjusted for ear independently or in a preset category of low medium or high or off you can adjust the frequencies in this eq area by either selecting from a preset or customizing your own moving back you can disable or enable the auto off feature when there is no music playing or voice prompts and configure what the smart button on the elite will trigger lastly you can activate trunote which measures the acoustical space between the eardrum and the speaker to ensure the response is optimal to minimize any unwanted resonance and distortionsi am just going to get straight to the point and say it the elite is as of today my favorite overall headphone and i never expected them to be i was merely curious from seeing their kiosk in bestbuy and having respect for jbl as a brand to care what these have to offer as well as i figured hey i have a day return window whats there to lose well these are the first bluetooth headphones i have owned that did not make me immediately want to plug them in to hear them at their full potential the wireless mode alone is simply excellent the anc does take a hit to the sound primarily in the sense of space and dynamics and resolution but it is more than listenable and when in a noisy environment is absolutely heaven the anc ability of the elite is roughly close to the qc but not quite there with anc off these sound great because these have a companion app to allow adjustments to the tonal balance i really cannot say how they sound in terms of a frequency response but in stock they sound very neutral with a slight tilt to being warm very slight i will just describe the characteristics of each frequency and to start it off the bass is tight quick and can deliver a healthy amount of sub bass it does run out of steam and distort when the sub bass is pushed to high levels that my vmoda crossfade wireless can handle with ease but overall the elite has a tighter and slightly more textured bass than the crossfade wireless the elite conveys a midrange that is open clean articulated and offers a nice depth to the point where sometimes i truly cannot believe i am using a wireless headphone no wireless headphones that i have tried has delivered this level of detail and clarity none treble once again is clean and if i had to nitpick it is not as clean and refined as say my best portables in this regard such as the bowers wilkins p or fidelio l for a wireless headphone this is honestly quite amazing when the elite is wired they improve slightly immediately ranking them up there with the best portables i have heard in terms of resolution and clarity from the stellar hour battery life to the nicely designed companion app to give me the ability to tune the sound the way i want to hear the music down to what seems like an exceptional design in acoustical engineering has

5,i never thought i could get excited over a remote control but i did with this one first of all let me state that i was on the fence after reading the reviews here on amazon but i took the plunge and so far im not regretting it this is my first harmony remote so i obviously cant make comparisons with previous models which might have been better than the unit presently under reviewit took me to minutes to set up and sync my new remote through the harmony software that was a breeze but its important that you know your system and how its individual components are connected to each other all my components were supported by the remote so no problems there i was able to customize the background image on the touchscreen a nice touch though not very importantonce the first sync from software to remote is completed the remote will work on your system as opposed to the previous situation where you had four remotes lying around you will now hit one button activity and your tv av receiver and third component will turn on all at once great at first this does not work flawlessly for instance you hit watch tv and everything might come on but the av receiver wont be on the right channel the great thing about this remote though is that it learns on the job it will ask you if the function performed as desired and if not how it can improve after my initial use with every component these flaws were pretty much ironed out i now have a perfect remote with no issues whatsoeverone downside to all this automation is that the harmony cannot predict when youve been fooling around with your equipment behind its back turned off your tv by hand using that devices own power button the harmony doesnt know so when you switch everything off through the remote again just one button your tv will come back on again you can work around this by customizing the color buttons on the bottom of the remote to be separate power onoff buttons for the individual components youll need to customize these buttons for every programmed activity so theres an initial time investment involved and of course there are no markings for these functions on the remote so youll have to memorize everything all in all this is not idealif you want to nitpick a few other minor cons are the sluggish touchscreen and slightly flimsy buttons this is nothing i can get worked up aboutnone of the downsides mentioned above can put a damper on my excitement im very happy with this product im still a tiny bit worried about the negative reviews and subsequently the longevity of this remote time will tell and ill adjust my rating if this thing fails within the first year or so so far id highly recommend it great product,"{'neg': 0.084, 'neu': 0.768, 'pos': 0.148, 'compound': 0.9906}",positive
5,while this is my first day using it i must say that i love this remote many of the issues that other users have cited have been solved for instance the touchscreen locks after inactivity so you can easily press buttons above the screen without worrying about accidentally pressing commands on the touch screen i also love that i can change perdevice command delays screen brightness and button backlighting its also worth noting that the picture shown includes older firmware the newer firmware looks more modern and sleek and like its predecessors can control the xbox one and xbox i couldnt get my old remote to do that the dock is also pretty coolthat said there are a few cons the top buttons are a bit awkwardly placed they can be hard to get to the remote comes with a preset buttonpress delay of seconds at first i thought the remote was just slow at processing commands but its actually a setting so you dont confuse older components i wish it was more obvious so i would have changed it sooner to remove that annoyance there are no physical number buttons on this remote this does not affect me as i do not have cabledishantenna but for those who do this could be an annoyance this ones weird i wish it were heavier im coming from a yamaha universal that came from my rxv and was pretty great and was also heavier i wish this remote was heavier seeing as its more powerful and much more expensive if im going to spend on a remote it should feel substantial in my handall in all none of those cons were enough to remove even one star this is by far the best remote ive ever owned as this is only my first day with it ill update this review in a month or so once ive gotten past the honeymoon,"{'neg': 0.055, 'neu': 0.782, 'pos': 0.163, 'compound': 0.988}",positive

5,brilliant product i have a somewhat more advanced home entertainment setup with a av receiver roku dvd and fairly new motorola dvr from fios and this configured and handled them all perfectly the first time i set it upthe genius of the product is that its programmed online and logitech has thousands of components already identified and they allow you to check in advance if your devices are directly supported with a lookup utility on their site i wasnt sure about my pioneer vsxtx thx receiver as its probably years old but it was no problem you connect the remote to your computer windows found the drivers online without issue then go to the logitech setup site and create an account if you dont already have one then you type in the model numbers of everything that you have if your setup is simple that may be all you need to do but they take care of multiple keypress needs very elegantly for example to play a dvd i have to change the plasma display to hdmi set the av receiver to dvd input then turn on the dvd logitechs setup anticipated the devices and the inputs that id probably be using so all i needed to do was to confirm and save then a single touch to the onscreen display on the harmony does it allbe aware that like most ir remotes it wants a pretty straight lineofsite to the components and any glass in between will weaken the signal my components are all in a cabinet with glass doors about feet from our seating area and remote control wasnt a problem although it was necessary to be pointing fairly directly at the cabinet if youre not sure about distances or want to be lazy when aiming pick up and install an ir repeater and it will solve that problemhonestly i have nothing negative to say about this device the ergonomics and setup are inspired and so human friendly that even my wife was impressed the seems expensive initially but if you consider programming a typical buttononly remote can take hours and i had this set up in minutes it quickly seems like money well spent,"{'neg': 0.05, 'neu': 0.775, 'pos': 0.175, 'compound': 0.9937}",positive

5,we had an older logitech remote that was programmable through their web app the puppy decided he liked the remote better than we did and although it still worked after the application of some csistyle crimescene reconstruction forensics and super glue it was time for a new remote now that he had grown upthis remote and the computerbased app is remarkable if you can follow simple directions the application walks you through each step i write instruction and repair procedures and i can tell you that the instructions in the app make it easy to get the remote working how you like well done logitechyou begin by entering the brand and model number of each device on one of the older devices it gave a screen message that there are control variations with that model and to consult them if there was a problem it also popped up that the roku was ir and rf and that this remote was only ir it even handled an old vcr and a notquiteasold dvd recorder ya were old so whatonce all your devices are entered you create activities for example for watching tv we use our receiver the lcd tv and the antenna it even asks if we wanted the onkyo or the tv to control the volume and what input on the tv to use for this activity and what input on the receiver i was easily able to create an fm activity to listen to the radio in the morning with dreary morning eyes just we only have to press the fm screen icon in the activities window on the touch screenadditionally i created two custom activities one for watching hulu and one for watching netflix using our roku i was able to customize it so that the remote would start the tv start the onkyo and select the roku at that point it sent the signals to emulate remote key selections for homeclick rightclick rightok to get to hulu i did much the same for netflix i found that these two custom activities would not go back and forth between the two the solution was to add a two second delay between home and go right the app made that easy as one of the custom items which could be selected in the app was add delay and you can select the length of the delay as well handy for troubleshooting should it become necessary the custom items such as the button presses can be reordered when programming them as well in that way when i found the two custom activities were not working properly i went back into the app added a delay and then moved the delay up to just after homeif you are not sure you can download the myharmony desktop software at the logitech website and program in all the various devices to see how it works before even purchasing the remotealthough i gave it five stars it is not perfect one problem i had with the last harmony remote model and this one as well is that it is made to fit in your hand unfortunately that same ergonomic design makes it very difficult to click something as simple as mute when the remote is sitting on the table allowing the application to autoprogram the favorite channels will work fine for most people but if you live in a rural area and get channels from different directions like when using an antenna rotor you cant automatically add the channels from both directions pick one or the other the solution is to add the channels you watch manually and that can be done right on the remote afterwards synch the remote on the computer and they will be saved there was well finally the battery is not meant to be user replaceable but a search on youtube will show you that it can be done fairly easily just in case the battery dies before the remote doesif i had known these things before i bought it would it have changed my mind no i have been writing reviews in the coffee industry for nearly years and try to be balanced in my appraisals this is why i added the abovethis model is evidently no longer for sale at logitech and i hope that this is not an indication that it is discontinued as that would be too bad if you dont need the home automation and smart phone app this remote might just be what you are looking for we got ours as a refurb for under delivered with sales tax what a deal,"{'neg': 0.039, 'neu': 0.881, 'pos': 0.08, 'compound': 0.9749}",positive

5,i have been using logitech items for quite a while from mice to previous remotes i was offered the chance to review this item and my impressions are favorable whats in the box you receive the remote plus the charging cradle and a brief instruction booklet aesthetic i have the previous harmony one remote and in comparison this unit is smaller it is simply much more compact the first obvious difference is the lack of a numerical keyboard second this unit is designed to sit vertically in the charger as opposed to horizontally with the previous model also the off button and many of the buttons are quite a bit smaller the bottom side has a nice rough material that seems resistant to slipping use first off i charged the remote for a while a couple of hours before doing anything once i got the unit turned on i was directed to add information i must confess that because i had a previous harmony the process of adding information was simple however one positive aspect is the account for adding information and that is adding the components of your system and needs by each activity tv dvd videogame console etc has been moved off from a computer based server to a cloud based server i did need to upgrade my account to the cloud by registering but the cloud seemed to understand my need to upgrade and simply asked for a connection through the included usb cord and transferred the information advantage while i have my laptop if for some reason my laptop takes a dive i can use another computer to upgrade my remote easilyactual use once i got everything squared away i turned on the tv with the remote and began to figure this system out this is quite a change from the previous remote the touchscreen in the middle is a important part of the system there are two buttons at the top a star for favorite channels easy to set up based on tv provider and channels available and a home button for activities once the thing is on you can switch between favorite channels activities a number pad and a command page by swiping around also there is a swipe on the bottom for bringing up the gestures page which enables the user to pause play and change volume amongst other functionsnicely there are buttons on the remote that make the touchscreen duplicativein many ways this system is a huge improvement over the previous version i was originally not able to understand the system but after a bit of use the ways of this remote become pretty intuitive i love how you can easily go to things like a help function more on that in a bit a devices button and ways to adjust the remote on the fly without having to access the cloud to update the remotewhat things didnt i like there are only a few things that are irritating on this remote based on my use first off i really wish that the remote didnt have the ir outlet on the bottom as opposed to the top like the previous remote as this seems to be line of sight which sometimes means that i have to hold the remote upwards rather than simply pointing for some this is probably okay but for me this seems dorky update once i posted this review someone thoughtfully pointed out that my supposed complaint about the ir sensor being on the bottom was incorrect and actually that button is for the remote learning function in fact i simply had to point the remote at the system as always guess what using the remote with the remote pointed at the system worked extremely well gone were the second presses and the irritations that the remote would miss some function it works and i havent had a problem since so this is not a problem at allanother irritation is that i think this remote makes it harder to have a older person or less techy person at the home as the help button is buried in the submenu instead of being readily available for those not familiar with the system though this is not something that occurs often it is something i think about and i think this was a bad mistake if you have older parents coming over this will be an issuesoverall in many ways this is a great remote i have really come to appreciate the touchscreen and the levels of menus accessible with this remote although there are some irritations i still think this is a very nice remote and well worth the purchase to make things more simplistic with the home theater who needs remotes with that in mind i really really like this item but i dont love it yet based on the quibbles above this doesnt mean that are better solutions around because i havent seen themupdate after some extensive use and modification i am really starting to love this item the ability to make some slight changes without having to hook this up to the computer is terrific such as modifying icon placements start positions and similar things this makes life easier as well as the overall use which as i become more used to the functions becomes far easier this is a great update and i am hiving some fun with even being able to modify individual icons on the channels awesome the software package makes this incredibly easy to do unlike the previous iteration which was far tougher,"{'neg': 0.033, 'neu': 0.796, 'pos': 0.171, 'compound':

5,im not going to go to much into it since many other reviewers have given in depth breakdowns of all this remotes features pros and cons i just wanted to quickly share my experience with this remote im using the remote only with no harmony hub first off this remote is about as sexy as remotes can get it feels great in the hand and is very ergonomic all of the buttons are easily accessible with one hand the battery came with enough juice for me to setup and tinker right out of the box setup is a breeze add devices add activities add favorites done in minutes max i initially had trouble with the activities the remote was not giving my tv long enough to turn on so it wasnt switching to the proper input i though i was going to have to go in and tinker with the delay settings but the remote asked me if everything went smoothly and when i told it no it asked me a few simple questions to determine what went wrong and get me watching immediately after that i had no more issues based on my answers to the questions it asked me it automatically adjusted the delays between commands no need to hook it back up to my computer on some of the older harmony remotes that ive used you had to turn all of your devices off in order to start a new activity with this remote the tv can stay on when i am in a watch blu ray activity and i press watch xbox it turns off my blu ray player turns on my xbox and switches the inputs on my tv fantastic i cant begin to express how pleased i am with this remote it replaced big clunky remotes and works like a charm that being said there are features i would like to see added and they are all things that can be added with a firmware update on logitechs end when switching activities i want it to ask me if i want to power off my current device instead of just doing it automatically i would also like the option to have the remote display a clock when docked that way it serves a purpose when its just sitting there on your end table it could also serve as a digital picture frame it could easily store a couple dozen photos and cycle through them while docked if those feature were added then remote controls can be improved upon no further if you can spare g buy it right now,"{'neg': 0.048, 'neu': 0.838, 'pos': 0.114, 'compound': 0.9814}",positive
5,ok i stole the review title from the infamous highlander movie but i did so because it does apply the harmony one in world of universal remotes really is the one remote that can replace all of your device remotes but does so at a seemingly steep price and with a small investment of time unless you are upgrading from another logitech remote and your devices are already input into your online logitech profilethis is my third logitech remote i am upgrading from an older model the the programming software i was using to update my is no longer used by logitech nor does it even recognize the ultimate one so despite logging in and repeatedly clicking upgrade remote the remote could not connect to the logitech website i wasted two nights and about two hours trying to solve this problem and finally learned via google that the one is not compatible with the old software it would have been nice if this had been noted somewhere on the instructionsi was less than thrilled when i learned i would need to create a new profile and user name rather than simply logging in at the logitech website with my existing information once i did thankfully it asked if i had an existing account and once i entered my old information it allowed me to port over all my existing devices so i got to where i needed to be but it took longer than it should havethose of you who have logitech remotes know that you enter your devices tv model dvd player home theater receiver model etc and then the software allows you to set up activities like watching a movie playing a game etc and the software prompts you with questions about which device controls what function eg which device controls sound and volume etc once this is all programmed you update the remote which is connected to your computer and off you go once this data is entered and configured the one really shines it lights up when you pick it up you can control all your devices of course with just the one remote you can even stagger power on or off order if you want it will set your tv and other devices to the correct inputs if they need to be changed between functionsi use an xbox one to watch my blu rays and dvds the xbox controller is a poor tv remote we like subtitles on when we watch dvds i was able to set up a quick one button macro in the logitech software that walks through the four button presses required on the xbox one to enable subtitles with a single button press on the ultimate one the software allows a high degree of customization that i really appreciateof course this programming ability is part of what drives the high cost of the product this isnt just a remote it is really a software driven input device with a touch screen i use a combination of the touch screen and my buttons depending on my mood it lights up when you pick it up feels good in your hands and in a feature i really like it has its own charging cradle past versions really ate up batteries i like returning it to its charging cradle after use because i know where it is when i need it again and it saves me the cost of replacing batteriesas others have noted not everyone would consider spending on a remote even if you are willing to spend the money you still need some basic technological prowess to program and fine tune this remote to make it work for you if you have relatives that still struggle with basic computer tasks or how to program their dvr to record their favorite shows this is not a product for them i have family members who could not ever hope to program this remote it is not a complex task to do so but for people who struggle with technology programming this remote could be a formidable taski have a fairly simple home theater lineup with no line of sight issues so i cant address using this with a hub but if you are sick of juggling remotes on movie night or want to upgrade an existing logitech the one is a great step forward,"{'neg': 0.042, 'neu': 0.881, 'pos': 0.077, 'compound': 0.9715}",positive
5,this is an initial review based on just having received my harmony one and getting it set up i will update it if my observations or opinions change i acquired this through my companys awards program otherwise i would have purchased it through amazon that said it is an expensive remote but i think it is worth the pricethis is my second harmony my first being the harmony i have been very happy with the but it was getting a little long in the tooth and i think some problems were developing so despite some of the negatives in reviews here i decided to give the ultimate one a tryfirst i would like to address the ergonomics issue specifically with regard to position of the controls for dvddvrbluray playback i agree that for some this is a significant negative but i think that ignores one major factor the harmony ultimate one is primarily a touch screen device these controls are available on the touch screen to access the movement controls you simply touch an up arrow button at the bottom of the screen there ive saved a bunch of people some heartache youre welcomefurther to the touch screen there are multiple screen pages available as with smart phones and other touch screen mobile devices you simply swipe through the screens even with the default settings you can control most if not all device and activity functions naturally after a limited time using the remote i will probably discover some things i want to tweak or add but thats true with any new deviceone feature that was not available on my which i plan to wipe and reprogram for a setup in a different room is the ability to download favourite channels based on your location zip code or postal code and provider whoa that is cool it saves a lot of timethe next new feature not available on my is that this is primarily a wifi based remote i wasnt sure how this would work and whether the hubblaster architecture would work properly for my physical entertainment centre however connecting to my wifi network was flawless and the signalling to devices has worked perfectly as far as i can tell at this pointand in regard to signalling the ultimate one is much faster than my maybe when i reprogram the i can speed it up but at this point i think the ultimate is just plain betterthe setup of the ultimate one was quick and painless the webbased installation gave me the option of transferring the settings from the to the ultimate and it worked perfectly even without this advantage firsttime owners of a harmony remote will find program so much easier than most other universal remotesafter getting the ultimate set up i downloaded the harmony control app for my ipond touch and my wife will download the app for her iphone and ipad my brief experience with the app is that it is cleanly designed and performs wellso my summary for initial impressions is that this is a great remote i frankly think that a lot of negative points in reviews are overblown i am not judging the reviewers but think that the overall perspective of having a solidly designed well manufactured remote that offers the performance that it does well my opinion is many if not of the most of the niggles are minor just my opinion,"{'neg': 0.038, 'neu': 0.804, 'pos': 0.158, 'compound': 0.9973}",positive
5,having owned one of each of the last four generations of logitech harmony remotes i should be immediately called out as a homer on the brand and concept and i am but ive had quibbles with all of them over time and ill go over some of those quibbles and why theyve been eliminated from the nearly perfect harmony ultimate onethe first quibble was size and feel it was difficult to reach buttons on larger versions of the harmony without swinging it twohanded like a broadsword this version is easy to manipulate from top to bottomthe second was the touchscreen with old harmony remotes the odds you could get through a tv session without accidentally brushing the touchscreen and landing inevitably on channel were next to nil this one does an excellent job of disregarding inadvertent contact with the screen in addition the screen is much more useful with swipe motions to go between the four major functions touchpad number pad function screen and channel screenthe third was the setup this is the main selling point for the harmony the ability to make all your devices function with one touch for an activity previously this required a lot of manual finesse one example my receiver needs about seconds after turning on to boot and receive additional commands with the old remotes i had to manually program in the delay with the ultimate one the delay is accounted for i cant imagine how much product testing and research by the logitech team went into the presets that accompany each device you add but i havent had to customize the remotes interaction with anything it just works,"{'neg': 0.049, 'neu': 0.796, 'pos': 0.155, 'compound': 0.9857}",positive
5,harmony ultimate one reviewa few weeks ago i received and then responded to an emailsurvey from logitech it pays to register your products to make a long story short although i am not a professional reviewer they chose to give me a harmony ultimate one universal remote to test and review as a customer how cool is that anyway regardless of how i got my hands on this unit i promise an honest review so here it goesease of setupwhen i received the ultimate one ill refer to it as the u for the remainder of the review i had already been familiar with the my harmony website where i had set up the us predecessor the harmony touch just like that endeavor setting up the u on the website was as simple as can get youre walked through each step beginning with finding your components on their huge database i had no trouble finding all my gear then arranging your activities eg watch tv listen to a cd play a video game etc and finally synching everything together to make it work the bigger and more complex your system the longer it may take you to set up the remote but the ease of it all remains the same using the website to set up the remote is a trouble free and actually pleasurable experience score out of ability to customizethe u allows for some pretty cool customization for one example you can upload jpeg photos for icons so in theory if you took a digital photo of yourself you can use that picture as an icon to watch tv the inner geek in me loves this stuff aside from that you can change background colors change the name of an activity like changing watch tv to living room tv adjust the touch screen brightness etc one cool feature is that you can adjust the brightness of the backlit hard buttons independent from the touch screen nice you can even choose how you want the unit to provide tactile vibration feedback when you press a touch screen buttonicon also a nice touch on the down side if youre into animated menus and icons you wont find any here score out of performanceease of usethe simplicity of the us setup transferred to its use logitech seems to get everything right off the bat after listing my gear and arranging my activities everything works perfectly i dont know how they do it but the delay times sequence of power oninput choice etc was perfect if for some reason it isnt you can always adjust as needed for tv viewing logitech harmony provides favorite channels which show up as icons on your u so if you program hbo hd into your favorites simply press the appropriate icon to get that channel the best part is the icons along with the corresponding channel numbers are selectable from logitechs impressive database simple as can get being that this is an ir remote with good line of sight coverage if you accidentally move away while turning your components on or off causing a part of your system not to respond to ir commands simply activate the help feature the u will guide you through all of your components ensuring that each one is on and the appropriate inputs are engaged in your display devicereceiverswitcher score out of ergonomicsmuch has been written about the transport buttons located on top of the us predecessor the touch they are still there on the u however the fast forward and rewind buttons perform double duty keep your finger pressed on either and you can skipgo back to the nextprevious blue ray dvd or cd chapter or track i like the vibrate feature when you hit a touch screen icon and the autoon based on motion are huge improvements over the touch in my opinion i dont know if logitech meant for it to be handled this way but concerning the aforementioned transport buttons on top of the remote i find that its easier to manipulate them with my forefinger than thumb the backside of the remote has a more tactile friendly feel like very light sandpaper the front touch screen surrounded by the hard buttons nestled onto the remote is quite attractive the noncontact areas finished in pianogloss black add to the fit and finish score out of valueits hard to assign a value rating on consumer electronics in my opinion one must decide does it make my life easier does it make my life more enjoyable if the answer to both of those questions is yes then whats an appropriate price for such bliss at the u isnt cheap however for a home theater nut like meits value is awesome would i recommend this remote for someone with just a flat panel and cable box absolutely not there are far less expensive options out there for that now if money is absolutely no object and you asked mei would say yes however i would also wonder why you dont have a more advanced complex system for the home theater enthusiast like me the u is a very good value after spending literally thousands over the years on home theater equipment is indeed a good value score out of plus and minusesplus incredibly easy set up and use gesture capability with customization can control devices comes with charger and one year warranty vibrate command option motion control backlight fifty channel favorites with appropriate iconsminus the infamous transport buttons located above the touch screen price for simple systems may not be a value you cannot replace the rechargeable batteryfinal thoughtsget this remote if you have components hidden away in cabinets or out of the direct line of sight for infrared then purchase the harmony hub about i use it in my home theater and it works beautifully however as a standalone remote the u has pretty good range for ir as did its predecessor the touch if you have more than a flat panel and a cable box this remote should be at the top of your list you will be able to set it up quickly and be able to use it efficiently final score out of,"{'neg': 0.023, 'neu': 0.774, 'pos': 0.203,

5,my experience with this remote has been nothing but a joyous one the setup on their website was not only easy but actually fun for me it was a four step process add components add activities add your favorite channels and one more im forgetting setting up my favorite channels took me the longest but im super organized so i was moving channels around and going through all of my channelsthe customization possibilities with this remote seems endless when there were buttons that were either missing or didnt do what i wanted it was super easy to either add a whole new buttonfunctionality by simply pointing my old remote at my harmony and teaching my harmony the new button or edit a current buttonyou can edit graphics as well such as the background or your favorite channel icons i also created a sequence basically a macro which worked perfectly fine my sequence was watch in d which while in my watch a movie activity had about steps of using my tvs d function i even added a delay of seconds before a couple actions such as waiting for a screen to fully display before the exit action was selectedcustomizing this remote does require some technical skills but thats expected with this remote i think it is pricey but for what it does and how its already programmed for each of my components i think i got my moneys worthif i had to nitpick its not as easy as it should be to connect the sync cable to the remote and also itd be much nicer if it was bluetooth instead of having to connect a cable to synci replaced remotes and it works great for allsharp tv lcleuyamaha receiver rxvsony bluray player bdpbxdvr receiver motorola vipxbox and ill soon be adding xbox onei have a wii u but this remote wont work with that which is fine because i use xbox for media streamingoverall i highly recommend this remote for anyone with the same needs as me,"{'neg': 0.062, 'neu': 0.771, 'pos': 0.167, 'compound': 0.9921}",positive

5,after owning a logitech and then the one and neither lasting for more than a couple years i decided to give logitech one more chance when i bought the smart control model nonultimate on a black friday deal my biggest complaint with both models was that after a couple short years or less they just did not seem to work as well either signals became weaker or macros got corrupted not surebut especially considering the cost of the one i was not impressed with the durabilityenter the smart control not ultimate model which i finally ponied up for after getting so frustrated with the one where the range seemed to deteriorate over time which is just amazingly frustrating the smart control to me represented the pinnacle of the line to date until i was able to review the ultimate which resolves pretty much every complaint i have about the non ultimate versionmake no mistake both are great but the ultimate imo really is worth that extra cost due primarily to the following differences ultimate adds the touch screen of course which solves the problem of having to use a phone to fix issues automated help when the macros dont do what is expected but of course also gives you access to all the detailed functions missing on the simple remote included with the nonultimate model charging station i really liked this about the one and i guess due to having a screen its more crucial to have this than with the nonultimate version which does not include a station its also just a good place to keep the remote so i always know where it is backlit keys seemingly small thing but for me personally this is a huge deal and one of the biggest reasons i prefer the ultimate over the nonultimate haptic feedback and tilt sensor again small things but both add to the advantage of the ultimate they are nice to have features that really helps the ultimate get that extra nod over the nonultimateand of course the success of both of these remotes is the smart hub imo even if you arent sitting far away or have devices in wall or behind cabinets this hub i think is the real key to the success over the previous models like the one and its predecessors so nice to not have to worry about ps integration not to mention the success rate of the macros working properly has increased to probably i would say about for the oneoverall the ultimate one represents years of development and tweaking and imo has resulted in an excellent remote to top the linecant recommend enough if you can get past the spendy price but i really dont see any other alternatives in the market with this kind of functionality at this price point,"{'neg': 0.041, 'neu': 0.792, 'pos': 0.167, 'compound': 0.9967}",positive

5,im a long time harmony remote user this will be the th modelupgrade ive had with the most recent being the harmony one my understanding is that this remote is similar to the harmony touch and identical to the remote in the harmony ultimate package with the ir hubthe big possible deal breaker here is the lack of a physical number pad i realize that can be a deal breaker for some people but its an obvious change and you know what youre getting in that regardthe device itself feels very well built i like the ergonomics but thats a matter of opinion of course aside from the physical number pad you are short a couple of physical buttons that appear on some other models but in exchange you have the wonderful feature of being able to assign a long and short press to each physical buttons distinguished by a nice haptic feedback allowing you to set a great deal of commands the other great feature compared to my previous remote is the ability to add and remove commands and rearrange the screen on the device itself without having to connect to a pc you still need to sync to a pc to change the physical buttons but its still a welcome additionthe tilt sensor which wakes the device when you pick it up is also much more sensitive and functional than my old harmony one which almost required a shake a small thing but again nicesome complain about the media controls play ff rw etc being at the top of the remote i dont find it that much of an issue plus the touchscreen allows you to set extremely helpful gesture commands which again can be setup from the device itself the options for gestures aretapdouble tapswipe leftswipe rightswipe upswipe downswipe left and holdswipe right and holdswipe up and holdswipe down and holdso by simply assigning swipe left and right as ff and rw and tap as playpause you have a nice alternative if the button layout bothers you but again i find the physical key positions are easy to get used tolastly there are the usual customization features most of which are either implemented better or at least more easily than previous models such as custom screen wallpapers customer activity icons unavailable on the harmony one etcall in all while the ergonomics and on screen number pad may be a bit unusual at first its a fantastic remote go and pick up and hold one in person at a store if possible so you know what it feels like but function wise its exactly what youd expect if you have experience with harmony remotes in the pastoh one last thing the battery isnt replaceable never a great product decision in my mind but i had my harmony one for almost years and it still held a charge for several days without issue so im not overly concerned the battery also doesnt last quite as long as my old harmony one possibly due to the larger screen but for me that means about or days instead of or which is not really an issueso in summary ive previously loved each harmony remote ive owned more than the last this case is a little different though my last harmony was definitely an incredible remote and each of my previous remotes were definite improvements over each other however in this case id say this one is less of an objective improvement and more of a change or alternative style in remotes there are a few extra features for sure but just looking at the physical remotes and their core functionality id say that the harmony ultimate remotes and the old harmony one are equal and it would come down to preference mostly in regards to the feel of the buttons and the ergonomics,"{'neg': 0.012, 'neu': 0.781, 'pos': 0.207, 'compound': 0.9993}",positive

5,ive been using a harmony for a bunch of years finally the buttons to select an activity and its associated controls started becoming intermittent and it was time to find something else i looked at the harmony ultimate hub and its associated controllers wifi but the limit of ir repeaters vs my multiple drawer layout just wouldnt work for me i finally settled on the ultimate one the drawers have glass frontsi downloaded the new myharmony app id been using the older java app for years but decided to give this one a try especially since it claimed to be able to transfer from my old heavily customized and it did about of all the customized buttons came over i needed to reassign the color keys at the bottom but that was easy to dothe one glitch i had was in setting up favorites i failed to notice that the favorites also automatically invokes one of your activities which would typically be watch tv unfortunately thats not the one it defaulted to after setting up all of the favorites i was wondering why it kept starting watch dvr when i touched a favorite rtfm the unpleasant part came when i could find no way to go back and change that without removing all of the favorites a call to tech support at pm edt came back with a recording that ts was closed please call back between am and pm anyhow after redoing the setup everything was fine except the channel logos were blurry and relatively uglyenter wwwiconharmonycom a great site for almost every channel logo imaginable i downloaded some logos from them and sent the author a little contribution via paypal for his efforts and uploaded those icons via myharmony they look a whole lot better i dont know why logitechharmony cant start with them out of the boxsimilarly the activity icons could use some help a quick google search turned up lots of icon sites i downloaded new icons and resized them to x using photoshop but there are a lot of apps that can resize images you then upload them via myharmonyall in all it took several hours worth of time at the computer and that was with all of the activities and devices already defined from my but at least part of that was my fault for not checking the favorites activity and then for wanting betterlooking iconsthe other thing ive noticed is that the ultimate seems to have a broader ir beam i dont need to be quite as careful in aiming it as with the as many others have commented i also wish it had physical number buttons but ive not found it that difficult to swipe the screen to get the number panel up similarly the ff playpause buttons at the top havent seemed to be such a nuisance as others have described but im used to using hands with the remote i also found it easier to move menuedit the favorites icons around onscreen on the remote vs on the appsomething thats a bit hidden away is the full device control on the you used the devices button to bring up another screen which then gave you all of the learned device controls on the ultimate you use the menudevices to get you to a similar screen of devices the to their detail controls,"{'neg': 0.038, 'neu': 0.835, 'pos': 0.127, 'compound': 0.9944}",positive

5,this is a quality product as it should be for the price i bought it to replace a harmony that failed after six months of use as compared to the the buttons are far better solid rather than spongy and on the singlefunction buttons a clear clicky feel though silent when acturated i understand the complaints of users who prefer buttons over touchscreen controls or find it clumsy to operate with one hand but neither is a concern for us in fact touchscreen control is very similar to a smartphone my somewhat technophobic wife found it easier to learn than the buttoncontrolled im using the unit without the hub since we already have an ir integrator that controls all the devices from a single sensor under our wallmounted tv the ir output seems very strong and unlike the standard time warner remote doesnt have to be close to and aimed directly at the sensorthe device worked properly after the basic activity setup using the windows software downloaded from the logitech website however i soon discovered that its even better after customization going beyond things like setting up favorite channels is not a job for the fainthearted some computer expertise is needed also the complete user manual should be downloaded from the logitech website before attempting a more detailed customizationunlike the i found it unnecessary to add commands for the individual devices that were omitted from the basic setup on the other hand the ability to finetune the delay and switching times for each device was a big plus with the ir output continued for a much longer time than it took to activate the devices this was a real nuisance if say the tv had been set at a high volume when it was turned off and if a low volume was needed when turning it back on i had to wait as much as seconds with the tv blaring until i could access the volume control not good if someone was asleep in the next roomfor me the need for a charging cradle is a plus it sits on my nightstand next to the bed is always handy and fully charged and doesnt disappear into the bedding onto the floor into a nightstand drawer or onto some other piece of bedroom furniture where i wouldnt think of looking for itmy only uncertainty about this remote is its longevity which i cant comment on because its still fairly new ive used logitech keyboards and trackballs for many years and have always found them very reliable after the failure of my im just a bit nervous and hoping for a better experience with the ultimate one,"{'neg': 0.058, 'neu': 0.845, 'pos': 0.098, 'compound': 0.9612}",positive

5,for reference my setup consists of an lg smart tv a directv hr receiver a sony soundbarsubwoofer a chromecast xbox ps and a wii u i wanted to consolidate the various remotes into one and make it stonesimple for the kids and me to press a single button and have all the inputs and devices align themselves for use properly tldr summary this remote and hub for the pswii u does this easily and i would recommend highlywanted to write a review to help anyone out there that like me wasnt too sure if this was going to be a good purchase or not there are some significantly negative reviews and some are probably genuine based on users actual experiences however there also seems to be more than a few that are based solely on a misunderstanding or misuse of the product if i can help clear any of that up and provide another perspective i hope i can do sofirst of all logitechs legacy product naming conventions compared to the current harmony line up as of early on their website can get confusing the names one ultimate home and touch can become frustrating when trying to figure out what is best for your remote control needs case in point i purchased this ultimate one ir remote knowing full well that id eventually need to add a hub to provide bluetooth control for our wii u and ps i ended up ordering the hub separately only to find later that i could have ordered this logitech harmony ultimate home touch screen remote for home entertainment and automation devices black and saved some money again note that according to logitechs current website that package is no longer offered but if you like this remote and think youll need or use the hub id recommend this package as best i can tell it is the same remote but with the addition of the hub for less then the price of the two were you to buy them individually like i did oh wellsecond the harmony compatibility site is pretty excellent just tell it the manufacturer and model number of your equipment and it will tell you pretty much everything you need to know what can be controlled what cant and which harmony products youll need comprehensive database of compatible devices to say the leastthird much has been said of the myharmony desktop software overall i thought it was fine relatively easy to use but you can tell its a work in progress as its not quite as slick and polished as the interface on the remote itself however while you may end up going in a couple of circles the software does always seem to realize what changes youve made and will ultimately guide you where you need to be it seems smart enough to realize that some users may do things in a different order based on their specific hardware and it catches up so to speak to ensure your remote and hub if you have one are kept in sync i dont think you need to be an expert to use it but i could see where some on the lower end of the technosavvy scale might not understand or have difficulty my overall feeling though is that if youre considering this line of products in the first place youll be fine with the softwaresidebar for a bit on the harmony home hub logitech harmony home hub for smartphone control of home entertainment and automation devices the ultimate one remote is infrared only so if you have any devices that require control via bluetooth like my ps or wii u youll need this hub if you want to control them with the remote you can apparently also use the smartphone app once you have the hub but i havent tried that and dont really have any intention either still nice to know its there you add the hub to your profile in the myharmony desktop software and there are a couple of ways to do this either by upgrading your remote with a hub or by setting it up as a new harmony device but both methods will get you there again the software will realize that installing the hub as a new device or upgrading the remote is the same thing and will route you through the required steps regardless of how you do it if you buy both set up the remote first then add the hub once set up the remote will have for example your activity named play ps and will signal the hub to provide the bluetooth signal to power on the ps works greatfourth ergonomics and usability lot of talk about the ergos and usability of this remote have to say i honestly find the negative reviews quite surprising in use this is one of the best pieces of consumer tech ive ever purchased works exactly as promised and way way more of a pleasure to use than a number of the reviews here make it out to be a big part of this is the operation and behavior of the screen its not like your smartphones screen prone to accidental brushes and taps it takes an appropriately deliberate touch to activate anything and each intentional press is confirmed by a nice little haptic feedback buzz vibration to let you know you what you wanted was selectedalso and why this is rarely mentioned is beyond me but the screen defaults to a lock screen meaning it lights up but wont register a touch or press until you swipe to unlock it in use lets say youre watching tv and the remote is just sitting there asleep you get up to do something or want to pause or even record to your dvr using the hardware buttons you can absolutely use those keys without inadvertently touching something on the screen and the screen will remain locked out there is apparently a setting where you can turn the lock screen feature off but im not sure why you would want to as it completely removes the issue of interference by your hand and again its not like an errant brush of the hand will cause an unwanted key selection anywayon top of that the screen features a slick gestures screen that slides up from the bottom and allows you to pause play volume up and down fast forward and rewind simply by sweeping your finger or tapping the screen without ever having to look down again this too works exceptionally well the gestures screen will persist too meaning if you slide it up to activate it then set the remote down and it goes back to sleep as soon as you pick it up again the gestures screen is still there i find myself leaving that screen open most of the time as its truly simple and intuitive to usea lot has been made of how unergonomic this remote is and i just dont get that at all in use it works extremely well and i really do not think logitech committed any massive deign errors rather it seems very well thought out and super cleverthe activities as you set them up via the desktop application just plain work it is fun to watch everything turn on and set themselves to the correct inputs and even if for some reason they wont the remote will guide you through how to fix them which when i read about that i didnt really understand until i saw it in action myself first time i went to use my play ps activity the ps did not power up the remote asked if everything came on i told it no it asked what device didnt i selected ps and it popped up a little tutorial on how to pair the harmony hub with the ps took maybe two minutes to pair the two and then worked perfectly very helpful and simplenavigating the screens is easy and there are only a handful of them dedicated home favorites and settings keys around the screen get you back to where you want to be immediately spend ten minutes using it and i promise youll have it down pat for every activity or mode if you will the controls on screen and the physical buttons assume the roles of the equipment you are currently using for example my watch tv activity means im controlling my directv receiver and the volume through my sony amp therefore the actions available on the screen and the physical buttons assume those roles by the way i find the hardware keys absolutely perfect for controlling the directv receiver likewise i can choose my watch smarttv activity and it will bring up the apps on my tv and let me select whatever app i want with the physical keys while the touchscreen displays my smarttv control selections same with ps wii xbox etc as you cycle through your modes the remote seamlessly offers you the appropriate control options pretty cool indeedfifth im not sure why battery life is such a concern it comes with a charging cradle seems like a nobrainer to me that when youre not using the remote just pop it in the cradle no assuming most of us have to work and kids if you have them are in school there has to be at least some portion of your day where you can let the remote charge up right when youre sleeping maybe just doesnt seem like this should be much of a concern longer term i hope the nonremovable battery lasts a good long while but im not too worried about itfinally ive been more than pleasantly surprised by how well this works granted im a smart remote neophyte and as with any review take this review with a grain or two of salt but i really and truly found this to be an exceptional product plus a fun grown up toy to boot unless you have equipment that really cannot be controlled by the harmony products i cant think of any major reason why i wouldnt recommend this its not inexpensive per se especially if you need the hub as well but for as well as it works and the capability it offers i think its a good value,"{'neg': 0.022, 'neu': 0.822, 'pos': 0.156, 'compound': 0.9998}",positive

5,i had a harmony for almost years till it broke last month then i purchased the harmony home control that device was totally useless in its programming and user friendliness all you could do was turn some devices on and off and adjust volume thats it everything else you and to do through the app which is a bigger disasterthen i purchased this device the logitech harmony ultimate one it was easy to program and wait you can control individual devices from the remote itself say you are listening to some music and want to change the sound settings on your receiver all you have to do is navigate on the onscreen remote and change dolby surround to say hall in vienna or something the same activity on the logitech harmony home is not possible and you will have to use the phone app to make the changei also like the favorite channels listed onscreen and can easily toggle between channels i really dont care that the number screen is the second or third swipe screen on the device since i rarely use it and the listed favorites channels can pretty much get me what i watchalso there is a gripe that the fwd and rewind buttons are on the top of the device that has not bothered me much at all it takes some time getting used to but not a deal breaker,"{'neg': 0.025, 'neu': 0.866, 'pos': 0.109, 'compound': 0.9018}",positive
